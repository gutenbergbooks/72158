<hr class='c008' />
<p class='c009'>It is with great diffidence that we offer this little book to the
public, it being, so far as we are aware, the first attempt at
a history of Anthropology. A book of small size which deals
with so vast a subject, comprising, as it does, so many
different studies, cannot satisfy the specialists in the several
departments. In many branches the investigations are so
recent that they can hardly be said to have a history, and in
some cases their originators are still alive. Doubtless many
will criticise the amount of space allocated to certain authors,
and wonder why others have been omitted or have received
but scanty recognition. All we can say in extenuation for our
selection is that the task has been by no means an easy one,
and we have partly been guided by the fact that our readers
will mainly be of British nationality. It has been impossible
to mention all of the more important of living workers,
whether investigators, collectors, or systematisers; but this is
not due to any lack of appreciation of their labours. In most
cases references are given in the text; a few supplemental
works will be found in the Bibliography at the end of the
book. The two dates which follow a name refer to the years
of the individual’s birth and death; a single date refers to the
date of publication of the book or memoir.</p>
<p class='c010'>We hope we have in all cases referred to the authors to
whom we are indebted for information; and for personal
assistance we desire to thank Dr. C. S. Myers, of Gonville and
Caius College; Mr. E. E. Sikes, Tutor of St. John’s College,
Cambridge; and Mr. Edward Clodd.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>In</span> his address to the Anthropological Section of the
British Association in 1892 Professor Alexander
Macalister made use of a little allegory to illustrate
the growth and progress of Anthropology.</p>
<p class='c010'>“On an irregular and unfenced patch of waste land,”
he said, “situated on the outskirts of a small town in
which I spent part of my boyhood, there stood a notice-board
bearing the inscription, ‘A Free Coup,’ which,
when translated into the language of the Southron,
conveyed the intimation, ‘Rubbish may be shot here.’
This place, with its ragged mounds of unconsidered
trifles, the refuse of the surrounding households, was
the favourite playground of the children of the neighbourhood,
who found a treasury of toys in the broken
tiles and oyster-shells, the crockery and cabbage-stalks,
which were liberally scattered round.... Passing by
this place ten years later, I found that its aspect had
changed; terraces of small houses had sprung up,
mushroom-like, on the unsavoury foundation of heterogeneous
refuse. Still more recently I notice that these
in their turn have been swept away; and now a large
factory, wherein some of the most ingenious productions
of human skill are constructed, occupies the site
of the original waste.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here we may recognise the three stages in the progress
of the science of Anthropology.</p>

<p class='c010'>First, a heap of heterogeneous facts and fancies, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>leavings of the historian, of the adventurer, of the
missionary—the favourite playground of <i>dilettanti</i> of
various degrees of seriousness. Next we see order
arising out of chaos, and the building-up of a number
of superstructures, bearing the signs of transitoriness
and imperfection, finally to be replaced by the solid
fabric of a coherent whole.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c010'>In this little book some of the earlier builders on
the scrap-heap will be noted—the Greek philosopher,
Aristotle; the Belgian anatomist, Vesalius; the
Englishmen, Tyson and Prichard; the Swede, Linnaeus;
the Frenchman, Buffon; and the German, Blumenbach.
These laid the foundations of the science, and each is
claimed as the true founder of Anthropology. After
these the workers become more numerous and more
specialised, and they will be dealt with under the
separate headings of the various branches of the subject
in which they laboured, rather than in a continuous
chronological order.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meddling with questions of merit or priority is a
thorny business at the best of times,” as Huxley said;
and completeness is not here aimed at. Mention can
be made only of those whose work notably contributed
to, or illustrates, the historical growth of the science.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be objected that too much attention has been
given to the arm-chair workers, and too little to the
labourers in the field. This is true, especially in the
section on Ethnology; but it is necessitated by the
compass of the volume. We attempt a brief sketch of
the wood, and cannot stop to describe the individual
trees that compose it. Detailed investigations, however
valuable, have to be merged into generalisations; and
generalisations proceed mainly from the arm-chairs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Professor Michael Foster somewhere remarked that
“hypothesis is the salt of science.” The main difficulty
with which observers in the field have to contend is
that, as a rule, they can see only what they look for.
When an investigator has left his field and is working
up his results at home, he only too frequently finds that
he has omitted to look for certain customs or beliefs,
whose occurrence in other places he had either over-looked
or forgotten. This is the justification for
the questionnaires. It is one of the most important
functions of stay-at-home synthetic students laboriously
to cull data from the vast literature of anthropology,
travel, and ancient and modern history, and to weld
them into coherent hypotheses. The student at home
in this way suggests fresh inquiries to the field ethnologist,
and a richer harvest is the result. The most
valuable generalisations are made, however, when the
observer is at the same time a generaliser; but “doubtless,”
as Maharbal said to Hannibal after the battle of
Cannae, “the gods have not bestowed everything on
the same man. You, Hannibal, know how to conquer;
but you do not know how to use your victory.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The vastness of the anthropological sciences and the
nebulous character of their demarcation from other
sciences render their definition or classification a
peculiarly difficult matter. Even at the present day
students are not agreed upon the exact terminology
and limitations of the various branches of their subject;
but, after all, these are little more than academic discussions,
since investigations go on irrespective of
boundary lines. Those who are really worried about
this “terminological inexactitude” are the cataloguers
and librarians, who frequently are at a loss where to
place items in their catalogues or books on their shelves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>It was mainly from this point of view that Dieserud
was constrained to write his <i>Science of Anthropology:
Its Scope and Content</i>.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> This useful little book deals
very fully in historical order with the questions referred
to above, and it may be recommended to those who
are interested in these somewhat profitless discussions.</p>

    <div><span class='c003'>THE PIONEERS OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Definition of the word “Anthropology.”</b></div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>, “the father of them that know,” as Dante
called him, is credited with having coined
the word “anthropologist”; but he did
not employ it in a very complimentary
sense. Describing a lofty-minded man
in his <i>Ethics</i>, he terms him ουκ ανθρωπολογος—not
a gossip, not a talker about himself. But
the word does not seem to have supplied a permanent
want in the Greek world, and we meet it next in a
Latin form in the sixteenth century. <i>Anthropologium</i>
was then used in a restricted sense, relating to man’s
bodily structure; and the first work in which it occurs
is generally stated to be Magnus Hundt’s <i>Anthropologium
de hominis dignitate</i>, which appeared in 1501,
and dealt in a general way with human anatomy and
physiology.</p>
<p class='c010'>The first appearance of the word in English was
probably in the seventeenth century, when an anonymous
book was published bearing the title <i>Anthropologie
Abstracted; or, The idea of Humane nature reflected in
briefe Philosophicall and anatomical collections</i> (1655).
The author defines his subject thus:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Anthropologie, or the history of human nature, is, in
the vulgar (yet just) impression, distinguished into two
volumes: the first entitled <i>Psychologie</i>, the nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the rational soule discoursed; the other anatomie, or
the fabrick or structure of the body of man revealed in
dissection ... of the former we shall in a distracted
rehersall, deliver our collections.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote c000' id='f2'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Bendyshe, p. 356.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c019'>The meaning of the word was scarcely clear in the
beginning of the nineteenth century, when we find, in
the <i>British Encyclopædia</i> of 1822, the following definitions,
“A discourse upon human nature,” and “Among
Divines, that manner of expression by which the inspired
writers attribute human parts and passions to God.”</p>
<p class='c010'>Concerning the present use of the term “Anthropology,”
few will take exception to the definition given
by Topinard in his <i>l’Anthropologie</i> (1876): “Anthropology
is the branch of natural history which treats of
man and the races of man.” It may be yet more
succinctly described as “the science of man,” which
comprises two main divisions—the one which deals
with the natural man (ανθρωπος, or <i>homo</i>); the other
which is concerned with man in relation to his fellows,
or, in other words, with social man (εθνορ, or <i>socius</i>).
At the end of the Introduction we give the classification
which we propose to adopt. It should, however, be
stated that, whereas in this country we employ the term
“Anthropology” to cover the whole subject, it is
common on the Continent to restrict the term to what
we designate as “Physical Anthropology,” “Anthropography,”
or “Somatology.”</p>
<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Fundamental Conceptions.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The beginnings of anthropology may probably be
traced to what Professor Giddings (1896)
has termed the “consciousness of kind,”
but what Dr. McDougall (1898) has more
definitely recognised as showing the gregarious impulse.
He says (pp. 299-300):—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The gregarious impulse of any animal receives satisfaction
only through the presence of animals similar to
itself, and the closer the similarity the greater is the
satisfaction.... Just so, in any human being the instinct
operates most powerfully in relation to, and receives the
highest degree of satisfaction from the presence of, the
human beings who most closely resemble that individual,
those who behave in like manner and respond to the
same situations with similar emotions.</p>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Race Discrimination.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The recognition of degrees of likeness implies the
recognition of unlikeness. This may be
termed the stage of race discrimination.
Ancient literature and the pictorial art
of certain uncivilised peoples abound in examples of
race discrimination. The crude representations of
human beings discovered in caves in France and elsewhere
were probably intended to portray the people
themselves, who lived in the palæolithic period. These
drawings or carvings, like those of most modern
savages, exhibit much greater skill in delineating
animals than human beings; consequently it is
dangerous to rely on them as representing the physical
characteristics of the then existing populations. Very
different is the famous Bushman pictograph of a fight
between Bushmen and Kafirs. Here relative size, the
difference in colour, and the employment of different
implements of war by these two races, are strikingly
exemplified; but as a general rule the Bushmen themselves
exaggerate certain features and minimise others—for
example, the head is invariably too small and
featureless.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Egypt there is an immense amount of pictorial
and sculptured material for ethnological study, covering
a range of many centuries. Over three thousand
years ago the artists—“untrained but not unobservant
ethnologists”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a>—decorated the walls of royal tombs
with representations of the four races of mankind,
among whom the Egyptians of the nineteenth dynasty
supposed the world to be partitioned—(1) The Egyptians,
whom they painted red; (2) the Asiatics or
Semites, yellow; (3) the Southerns or Negroes,
black; and (4) the Westerns or Northerners, white,
with blue eyes and fair beards. Each type is
clearly differentiated by peculiar dress and characteristic
features. In addition to these four types,
other human varieties were delineated by the Ancient
Egyptians, most of which can be identified. “On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Egyptian monuments we not only find very typical
portraits, but also an attempt at classification; for the
Egyptians were a scientific people, with a knowledge
of medicine, and also skilled mathematicians; therefore
their primitive anthropology is not unexpected.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
This facility for race discrimination was still earlier
exhibited in the prehistoric or early historic slate
palettes of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Belonging to the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> are the realistic

Flinders Petrie at Memphis,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> “which clearly are copied
from various races which were welded together by the
Persians, and who all met in the foreign settlement at
Memphis.” Professor Petrie identifies Sumerians or
Accadians, the old Turanian people who started civilisation
in Babylonia. “Their heads are identified by
closely similar portraits carved in stone about 3000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
and found in Mesopotamia.” Persians, Scythians,
Mongols, and even Indians, are also recognised by him;
but some of the latter are dated by him at about 200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Assyrian monuments are less explicit in this respect.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Assyrians themselves are shown to have been of
a very pure type of Semites; but in the Babylonians
there is a sign of Cushite blood.... There is one portrait
of an Elamite (Cushite) king on a vase found at Susa;
he is painted black, and thus belongs to the Cushite
race. The Ethiopian type can be clearly seen in the
reliefs depicting the Assyrian wars with the kings of
Ethiopia; but it is hard to discriminate Arabs and Jews
from Assyrians; in fact, it is only in the time of good
art that distinctions are traceable.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Rock carvings in Persia, Scythian coins, and numerous
other monuments and remains from other countries and
belonging to diverse ages, illustrate that the head-form,
features, character of the hair and mode of wearing it,
ornaments, dress, and weapons, were all recognised as
means of discriminating between different peoples from
the earliest times.</p>
<p class='c010'>Ancient literature, of which one example must suffice,
tells the same tale:—</p>

<p class='c021'>The sense of differences of colour, which, for all our
talk of common humanity, still plays a great and,
politically, often an inconvenient part in the history of
the world, finds forcible expression in the Vedic descriptions
of the people whom the Aryans found in possession
of the plains of India. In a well-known passage the
god Indra is praised for having protected the Aryan
colour, and the word meaning colour (<i>varna</i>) is used
down to the present day as the equivalent of caste, more
especially with reference to the castes believed to be of
Aryan descent.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c019'>The word “caste” is of Portuguese origin. In the 179th
hymn of the first Mandala of the Rig-Veda, as Dr.
Gerson da Cunha points out,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> the word <i>varna</i> is used
in the dual number, <i>ubhau varnau</i>, “two colours,”
white of the Aryans and black of the Dasyus—that is,
of the “Dravidian” aborigines, who are elsewhere
called “black-skinned,” “unholy,” “excommunicated.”
Other texts dwell on their low stature, coarse features,
and their voracious appetite. The Rig-Veda employs
the word <i>anâsa</i>—“noseless”—to characterise the Dasyus
and Daityas, which designations mean “thieves” or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“demons.” It is hardly an exaggeration to say that
from these sources there might be compiled a fairly
accurate anthropological definition of the jungle tribes
of to-day.</p>

Anthropology,” <i>Journ. Anth. Soc. of Bombay</i>, 1892, p. 542.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus were the foundations of descriptive anthropology
unconsciously laid.</p>

<p class='c010'>In our own day racial characters are seized upon in
the same manner, and racial antipathy adds fuel to its
own fire in regarding traits which differ from those of
the speaker or writer as being ugly, objectionable, or
of low type. “The study of race,” said the late Sir
William Flower (1831-1899), “is at a low ebb indeed
when we hear the same contemptuous epithet of

<div class='sidenote'><b>Hippocrates.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Hippocrates (460-357 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), “the Father of Physic,”
was certainly a pioneer in physical
anthropology. He says: “I will pass
over the smaller differences among
nations, but will now treat of such as are great either
from nature or custom; and, first, concerning the
macrocephali. There is no other race of men which
have heads in the least resembling theirs.” He believed
that this elongated conformation of the head was
originally produced artificially; but subsequently it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>inherited, or, as he puts it: “Thus, at first usage
operated, so that this constitution was the result of
force; but in the course of time it was formed naturally,
so that usage had nothing to do with it”—a view
adopted many centuries later by Buffon and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Aristotle.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Not only was Aristotle (384-322 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) the first
authority to make use of the word
“anthropology,”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> but he may also be
described as an anthropologist. Material
had been collected by travellers, such as Hanno, the
Carthaginian, who encountered gorillas in Africa; by
historians, such as Herodotus (who was also a traveller);
and by doctors, such as Hippocrates. Aristotle was
indebted to some extent to all of these; but his vast
works in natural history were based mainly on what
he considered of primary importance—facts of actual
personal knowledge derived from personal observation.
On this account alone his writings deserved the place
which they held for many centuries.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus, undisturbed by the dogmas of religion or
philosophy, he placed man naturally among the animals
(being thus, as Topinard remarks, about twenty
centuries ahead of humanity), but distinguished from
them by certain features—by the relative size of the
brain, by two-leggedness, by mental characters, etc.
Some writers regard it as improbable that either Hippocrates
or Aristotle had ever dissected the human body,
but it is also possible to hold an opposite view. Even
Galen (c. 130 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), whose anatomy held the field for
more than a thousand years, had to base his conclusions
on the bodies of animals, notably on those of monkeys;
and, although he did not conceal the fact, it was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>until the time of Vesalius that the discrepancy between
simian and human anatomy was discovered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Vesalius.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Vesalius (1513-1564) is the next great name in the
history of physical anthropology. He
was Professor of Anatomy at Padua,
Bologna, and Pisa, and physician to
Charles V. and Philip II. His work marks a revolution
in anatomical science; for not only did he overthrow
the doctrines which had been accepted for fourteen
centuries, demonstrating that to a great extent Galen
had studied the anatomy of the ape rather than that
of man, but, by his own deductions from direct observation
and original research, he established a fresh and
unassailable foundation for future investigation. His
services to anatomy have been compared to those of
Galileo and Copernicus in the field of astronomy. His
fate was not unlike that of many other daring pioneers
of the Middle Ages. He was accused of having
dissected a man while yet alive, and was dragged by
his enemies before the Inquisition and condemned to
death. By the intercession of the king his sentence
was commuted into a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre;
but on his return journey he was shipwrecked and
drowned off the island of Zante.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cunningham, in his Presidential Address to the
Royal Anthropological Institute, 1908, refers to the
work of Vesalius, whom he describes as one of the
most remarkable figures in the sixteenth century. He
adds:—</p>

<p class='c021'>It is interesting to note in passing that certain racial
distinctions did not escape the eye of Vesalius. “It
appears,” he remarks, “that most nations have something
peculiar in the shape of the head. The crania of
the Genoese, and, still more remarkable, those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Greeks and Turks, are globular in form. This shape,
which they esteem elegant and well adapted to their
practice of enveloping the head in the folds of their
turbans, is often produced by the midwives at the solicitation
of the mother.” He further observes “that the
Germans had generally a flattened occiput and broad
head, because the children are always laid on their backs
in the cradles; and that the Belgians have a more
oblong form, because the children are allowed to sleep
on their sides.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We know that more or less continuous pressure is
exerted on the pliable heads of infants to produce
admired shapes, but the theory was carried rather too
far when adduced, some centuries later, to account for
the facial features of negroes. Lawrence, in his
<i>Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</i>, attributed the flat
noses and thick lips of the negro to the method of
carrying babies in Africa. The negro mothers, while
at work, carry their infants on their backs, and “in the
violent motions required for their hard labour, as in
beating or pounding millet, the face of the child is said
to be constantly thumping against the back of the
mother.” By this rude treatment the face of the negro
child was supposed to be moulded into shape; but, as
Cunningham points out, no attempt was made to
explain how the process of bumping produced exactly
opposite results in the case of the nose and lips—reducing
the prominence of the former and increasing
the projection of the latter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Spigel.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>“The invention of the ‘lineæ cephalometricæ’ of
Spigel, who died in the early part of the
seventeenth century, may perhaps be
regarded as constituting the earliest scientific attempt
at cranial measurement.” He drew four lines in certain
directions, and a skull in which these lines were equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to each other he regarded as regularly proportioned.
“Although these lines are evidently not sufficient for
the comparative ethnography of the present day, yet it
is interesting to observe that, in ascending the zoological
scale, these lines approximate equality just in
proportion as the head measured approaches the human
form.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Johann Sperling, author of a <i>Physica anthropologia</i>
(1668), and Samuel Haworth, who wrote <i>Anthropologia;
or A philosophical discourse concerning man</i> (1680),
also belong to the seventeenth century. But more
important is the work of Edward Tyson,
a Cambridge man, who took his degree
of Doctor of Medicine in 1678. He was a Fellow, and
later Censor, of the College of Physicians, Fellow of
the Royal Society, and writer of numerous papers on
anatomy. His fame rests mainly on the work which
laid the foundations of comparative morphology,
<i>Orang-Outang, sive Homo Sylvestris: or The Anatomy
of a Pygmie compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape,
and a Man</i> (1699). This was the first attempt to deal
with the anatomy of any of the anthropoid apes, and
shows very conspicuous ability on the part of the
author. He compared the structure of man with that
of the monkeys, and came to the conclusion that the
pygmy formed a kind of intermediate animal between
the two. The pygmy was, as a matter of fact, a
chimpanzee, and its skeleton, which was thus early
recognised as the “missing link,” is still to be seen in
the Natural History Museum (British Museum) at
South Kensington. Tyson added to his work on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><i>Anatomy of the Pygmie, A Philological Essay, Concerning
the Pygmies, the Cynocephali, the Satyrs, and
Sphinges of the Ancients. Wherein it will appear that
they are all either Apes or Monkeys, and not Men as
formerly pretended.</i> The purpose of the <i>Essay</i> may be
expressed in his own words:—</p>
<p class='c021'>If therefore I can make out ... that there were such
<i>Animals</i> as <i>Pygmies</i>; and that they were not a <i>Race</i> of
<i>Men</i>, but <i>Apes</i>; and can discover the <i>Authors</i>, who have
forged all, or most of the idle Stories concerning them;
and shew how the Cheat in after Ages has been carried
on, by embalming the Bodies of <i>Apes</i>, then exposing them
for the <i>Men</i> of the Country, from whence they brought
them: If I can do this, I shall think my time not wholly
lost, nor the trouble altogether useless, that I have had
in this Enquiry.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>The Pygmies.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>This was the first attempt to explain in a rational
fashion the innumerable tales found in
all parts of the world about the existence
of pygmy races, ape-men or men-apes.
Tyson’s hypothesis was that all these legends were
based on imperfect observations of apes, and he was
followed by Buffon and others. It may be well here
briefly to note the researches which have led in late
years to the opposite conclusion—<i>i.e.</i>, that the tales
relate to a dwarf race of men formerly very widely
spread over the globe.</p>

<p class='c010'>This theory is mainly associated with the name of
de Quatrefages (1810-1892). In the Introduction to
his book on the pygmies he says: “For a long time
past the small black races have attracted my attention
and my interest in a special manner.” His earliest
investigations of the subject were published in 1862,
and continued until 1887. Analysing the evidence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>he shows that the two localities where the ancients
appear to place their pygmies (the interior of Africa
and the southern-most parts of Asia), together with the
characters assigned to them, indicate an actual knowledge
of the two groups of small people (Negrilloes
and Negritoes), who are still to be found in those
regions. Professor J. Kollmann, of Basel, in his
<i>Pygmäen in Europa</i> (1894), argues for the existence of
a European pygmy race in Neolithic times from some
remains found at Schaffhausen, and the wide prevalence
of short statures among many peoples in Europe,
especially in the south. Mr. David MacRitchie attributes
not only legends of pygmies, but fairy-tales in
general, to this prehistoric dwarf race. President
Windle sums up the question thus:—</p>

<p class='c021'>It is possible with more or less accuracy and certainty
to identify most of those races which, described by the
older writers, had been rejected by their successors.
Time has brought their revenge to Aristotle and Pliny
by showing that they were right, where Tyson, and even
Buffon, were wrong. (P. liii.)</p>

<p class='c014'>In the time of Aristotle Man took his place naturally
at the head of the other animals, being distinguished
from the brutes by certain characters. But the
influence of religion and of philosophy did not long
permit of this association. Man came to be regarded
as the <i>chef d’œuvre</i> of creation, a thing apart, a
position aptly described in the words of Saint Paul
(marginal version) “for a little while inferior to the
angels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the eighteenth century came a startling change.
Man was wrenched from this detached and isolated
attitude, and linked on once more to the beasts of the
field. This was the work of Linnæus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Linnæus.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The year 1707 is memorable in the history of Anthropology
as the date of the birth of two of
its greatest men, Linnæus<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a> (1707-1778)
and Buffon (1707-1788). Both devoted
long lives to science, and both produced monumental
works of permanent value; but it would be hard to
find two contemporary figures engaged in the same
pursuit whose lives presented a greater contrast.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By a patent of nobility conferred in 1757 Linnæus became
Karl von Linné.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Linnæus was the son of a poor pastor, and his mother
was the daughter of the former pastor of the same small
Swedish parish. At the early age of four young Karl
is said to have taken an interest in botany, and to have
begun to ask questions that his father could not answer.
Either to escape this interrogation, or for wiser motives,
the father made it a rule never to answer the same
question twice, and to this early discipline Linnæus
used to trace his tenacious memory. The boy was
intended for the ministry, and was early sent to school;
but, as he devoted all his time to botany, his progress
in theology was <i>nil</i>, and when, after two years, his
father visited the school, and learnt of the disappointing
result of all the pinching and saving which had gone to
provide for the son’s education, he resolved to apprentice
him to a tailor or shoemaker in hopes of obtaining
a better return for his outlay. Fortunately a friend
intervened, and gave the boy board and lodging,
besides private tuition, while he finished his gymnasium
course. His work as a student seems to have failed to
satisfy his instructors, for when he proceeded to the
University of Lund it was with the enigmatic testimonial
to the effect that “some shrubs in a garden may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>disappoint the cares of the gardener, but if transplanted
into different soil may prosper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When barely twenty-two he left Lund for Upsala,
taking with him his entire fortune of £8, and, being
inexperienced and unknown, soon found himself in
desperate straits. He was rescued by the generosity
of Dr. Celsius, a professor of theology, but student of
botany, who, impressed with Karl’s collections and
enthusiasm, offered him board and lodging, and
obtained for him some private pupils. The hardships
of his life were not yet over, but gradually his work
obtained recognition, abroad sooner than at home, and
he could have lived at his ease in England or the
Netherlands; only (as he expressed it), “his Sara was
in Sweden,” and he returned to his native land to
scrape together sufficient means to marry her.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Buffon.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>From the beginning Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte
de Buffon, was marked out for a different
life. His father was a Burgundian
Councillor, and his mother, besides
being an heiress, was a woman of unusual ability. He
was originally destined for the law, but his tastes
always inclined towards science, and he soon found
occasion to follow them.</p>

<p class='c010'>He made the acquaintance of a young Englishman of
rank and of his tutor, who was a man of science, and
with them he travelled on the continent. About the same
time Linnæus was also travelling, but in a different
fashion. He set out to make explorations in Lapland,
then very little known, carrying his luggage on his
back, and covered nearly 5,000 miles at a cost of
about £25. During his travels he kept a diary<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a> of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>observations, which contains not only botanical but
also ethnological information of great value.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <i>Globus</i>, “Linné als Ethnologe,” xci., 1907.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>While Linnæus was living from hand to mouth,
depending for his food on chance generosity, and
mending his boots with folded paper, Buffon was living
the gay life of the young men of his age and rank, and
we hear of him being forced to flee to Paris to escape
the results of wounding an Englishman in a gaming
quarrel. (Linnæus was also guilty of drawing his
sword in anger, but the provocation was different.
During his absence from Upsala a rival had, by private
influence, contrived to get a prohibition put on all
private lecturing in the University, and he returned to
find all his means of livelihood suddenly cut off.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless Buffon’s life of pleasure did not occupy
all his energies. He possessed, as Voltaire said,
“<i>l’âme d’un sage dans le corps d’un athlête</i>,” and while
in Paris he wrote and translated various scientific
works, was elected a member of the Academy of
Science, and in 1739 was appointed keeper of the
<i>Jardin du Roi</i> and of the Royal Museum.</p>

<p class='c010'>The permanent value to Anthropology of the work
of these two men lies in the fact that they both “saw
life steadily, and saw it whole.” But they produced
results not only distinct, but, in some respects,
antagonistic. Buffon, as Topinard says, did not
classify, he described; and the value of his work has
been very differently appraised. Cuvier had small
opinion of it. Camper and Saint-Hilaire considered
the author the greatest naturalist of modern times, the
French Aristotle. Topinard (1885, p. 33) thus describes
the opinion of the public: “Le public, lui, n’hésita
pas; dans <i>l’Histoire naturelle des animaux</i> il sentit un
souffle nouveau, vit un pressentiment de l’avenir. La
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>libre pensée était dans l’air, 89 approchait; l’œuvre de
Buffon, comme l’Encyclopédie, Voltaire, Rousseau et
Bougainville, contribua à la Révolution française.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The genius of Linnæus lay in classification. Order
and method were with him a passion. In his <i>Systema
Naturæ</i> he fixed the place of Man in Nature, arranging
<i>Homo sapiens</i> as a distinct species in the order <i>Primates</i>,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
together with the apes, the lemurs, and the bats. He
went further and classified the varieties of man, distinguishing
them by skin colour and other characters into
four groups—a classification which holds an honourable
place at the present day.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The tenth edition, 1758, is the first in which the order
<i>Primates</i> occurs. Earlier editions have the order <i>Anthropomorpha</i>.
See Bendyshe, p. 424.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>All this was abominable in the eyes of Buffon. “Une
vérité humiliante pour l’homme, c’est qu’il doit se
ranger lui-même dans la classe des animaux”; and in
another place he exclaims: “Les genres, les ordres,
les classes, n’existent que dans notre imagination....
Ce ne sont que des idées de convention.... Il n’y a que
des individus!” And again: “La nature ne connait
pas nos definitions; elle n’a jamais rangé ses ouvrages
par tas, ni les êtres par genres.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless both rendered incalculable service to
the science. Linnæus “found biology a chaos and left
it a cosmos.” “L’anthropologie,” says Flourens,
“surgit d’une grande pensée de Buffon; jusqu-là
l’homme n’avait été étudié que comme individu, Buffon
est le premier qui l’ait envisagé comme espèce.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Buffon was no believer in the permanent stability
of species. “Nature is far from subjecting herself to
final causes in the formation of her creatures.” He
went so far as to make a carefully veiled hint (the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Sorbonne having eyes on him) of a possible common
ancestor for horse and ass, and of ape and man. At
least, he says, so one should infer from their general
resemblance; but, since the Bible affirms the contrary,
“of course the thing cannot be.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a> In 1751 the old
naturalist was constrained by the Sorbonne to recant
his geological heresies in these words: “I declare that
I had no intention to contradict the text of Scripture;
that I believe most firmly all therein related about the
Creation, both as to order of time and matter of fact.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was fortunate for the nascent science that the next
great name on its roll was that of a man
of very wide reading, endowed with
remarkable reasoning powers, and with
an exceptional perspicuity for sifting out the true from
the false.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840) was Professor
in the Faculty of Medicine at Göttingen, and
early turned his attention to the special study of man.
He was the first to place anthropology on a rational
basis, and in his <i>De generis humani varietate nativa</i>
(1775-1795) laid the foundations of race classification
based on measurement. He noted the variations in
the shape of the skull and of the face, and may therefore
be regarded as the founder of craniology (see below,
p. <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>). Besides the services rendered by Blumenbach
to the science of anthropology in classification and in
laying the foundations of craniology, there was a third
field in which his work was perhaps even more valuable
to his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every successive age is astonished at the credulity
of its predecessor; but when we remember
the grave difficulties which beset
the explorer in the eighteenth century,
and the wild “travellers’ tales” which it was impossible
either to verify or to disprove, it is easy to sympathise
with the credence given to the beliefs in “Anthropophagi,
and men whose heads do grow beneath their
shoulders.” Tyson, in his <i>Philological Essay</i>, gives a
list, chiefly derived from classical writers, of the
“monstrous Productions,” belief in which had not
altogether died out in the seventeenth century. In
fact, it was not long before Tyson’s time that a distinguished
naturalist had given a serious description of

the East Indies “are caught and made use of in houses
as servants to do the lighter domestic work—as to
carry water, lay the table, and take away the plates.”
But all these were classed among the <i>Simiæ</i>. Within
the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> Linnæus included wild or
natural man, <i>Homo sapiens ferus</i>, whose existence was
widely believed in at the time. The
most authentic case was that of “Wild
Peter,” the naked brown boy discovered
in 1724 in Hanover. He could not speak, and showed
savage and brutish habits and only a feeble degree of
intelligence. He was sent to London, and, under the
charge of Dr. Arbuthnot, became a noted personage,
and the subject of keen discussion among philosophers
and naturalists. One of his admirers, more enthusiastic
than the others, declared that his discovery was more
important than that of Uranus, or the discovery of
thirty thousand new stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>Blumenbach alone, apparently, took the trouble to
investigate the origin of Wild Peter, and in the article
he wrote on the subject disposed for all time of the belief
in the existence of “natural man.” He pointed out
that when Peter was first met he wore fastened round
his neck the torn fragments of a shirt, and that the
whiteness of his thighs, as compared with the brown of
his legs, showed that he had been wearing breeches
and no stockings. He finally proved that Peter was the
dumb child of a widower, who had been thrust out of
his home by a new step-mother.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

    <div>THE SYSTEMATISERS OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hitherto</span> we have been dealing with the great pioneers
in Anthropology, those who laid the foundations, brought
order out of chaos, and suggested the outlines of future
work. Henceforward Anthropology may claim the
name of a science, and the work developed on definite
lines. It will be more convenient to treat these separately,
abandoning a strict chronological method.</p>
<p class='c010'>The first branch to attract workers was Somatology,
the physical aspect of man, of which we have already
noted the inception: not until the nineteenth century
can Archæology, or Prehistoric Anthropology, be said to
have developed into a science; while the scientific study
of Ethnology, or Cultural Anthropology, is barely half
a century old.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Craniology.</b></div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Norma Verticalis of Blumenbach.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Somatology had already been foreshadowed by Vesalius,
Spigel, and Linnæus; but Blumenbach
was the first to strike its keynote
by recording the shape of the
skull and of the face. He was the fortunate possessor
of a large number of skulls—large, that is, for his time,
and he published a description of them (1790-1820),
<i>Decas collectionis suae craniorum diversarum gentium
illustrata</i>, with 70 plates. He noted particularly the
<i>norma verticalis</i>—<i>i.e.</i>, the shape of the
skull as seen from above, distinguishing
by its means three types—the square
shape of the Mongols, the narrow or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“pressed in from the sides” shape of the Negroes, and
the intermediate form which he recognised in the
“Caucasians.” He was the first to popularise
craniology, and “it became the fashion to visit the
Blumenbachian Museum, to have the differences which
distinguish the different cranial types pointed out, and to
indulge in sentimental rhapsodies upon the beauty and
symmetry of the young female Georgian skull, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>considered to represent the highest type of all.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a> But
Blumenbach does not seem to have taken advantage of
his own discoveries. In choosing the <i>norma verticalis</i>
as a racial criterion he made a valuable contribution to
science, but he did not reproduce his <i>normæ</i> in his plates,
nor did he base his classification on them. Indeed, his
typical Caucasian skull is really squarer than his typical
Mongolian.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Facial Angle of Camper.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Peter Camper (1722-1789) had already been studying
head-form, though from a totally different
standpoint, and his deductions
were not published until after his death.</p>

<p class='c010'>His contributions to Anthropology were an essay on
the <i>Physical Education of the Child</i>, a lecture on <i>The
Origin and Colour of the Negro</i>, and a treatise on
<i>The Orang-outang and some other species of Apes</i>;
but only his work on the facial angle has attained permanent
fame. His early inclinations were towards art,
and he was carefully trained in drawing, painting, and
architecture; and it was in the interests of Art, not of
Anthropology, that the researches which resulted in his
determination of the facial angle came to be undertaken.
This he describes in his preface to his lectures:—</p>

<p class='c021'>At the age of eighteen, my instructor, Charles Moor
the younger, to whose attention and care I am indebted
for any subsequent progress I may have made in this art,
set me to paint one of the beautiful pieces of Van
Tempel, in which there was the figure of a negro, that by
no means pleased me. In his colour he was a negro, but
his features were those of a European. As I could
neither please myself nor gain any proper directions, I
desisted from the undertaking. By critically examining
the prints taken from Guido Reni, C. Marat, Seb. Ricci,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and P. P. Rubens, I observed that they, in painting the
countenances of the Eastern Magi, had, like Van
Tempel, painted black men, but they were not Negroes.</p>
<p class='c022'>To obtain the necessary facial effects distinguishing the
Negro from the European, Camper devised his system
of measurements. He drew a line from the aperture of
the ear to the base of the nose, and another from
the line of the junction of the lips (or, in the case of
a skull, from the front of the incisor teeth) to the most
prominent part of the forehead. “If,” he said, “the
projecting part of the forehead be made to exceed the
100th degree, the head becomes mis-shapen and assumes
the appearance of hydrocephalus or watery head. It is
very surprising that the artists of Ancient Greece should
have chosen precisely the maximum, while the best
Roman artists have limited themselves to the 95th
degree, which is not so pleasing. The angle which the
facial or characteristic line of the face makes,” he continued,
“varies from 70 to 80 degrees in the human
species. All above is resolved by the rules of art; all
below bears resemblance to that of apes. If I make
the facial line lean forward, I have an antique head; if
backward, the head of a Negro. If I still more incline
it, I have the head of an ape; and if more still, that of
a dog, and then that of an idiot.”</p>
<p class='c010'>Camper’s facial angle may be of service to Art, but
since the points from which the lines are drawn are all
variable, owing to the disturbing influence of other
factors, such as an increased length of face or an
unusually prominent brow-ridge, it cannot form an
accurate measurement for Anthropology. It was
severely criticised by Blumenbach, Lawrence, and
Prichard, but adopted in France, and by Morton in
America.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Dr. J. Aitken Meigs<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a> pointed out that as early as
1553 the measurement of the head appears to have
exercised the ingenuity of Albert Dürer, who, in his
<i>De Symmetriâ Partium in Rectis Formis Humanorum
Corporum</i>, has given such measurements in almost every
view. These, however, are more artistic in their tendency
and scope than scientific. A glance at some of
the outline drawings of Dürer shows incontestably that
the facial line and angle were not wholly unknown to him,
and that Camper has rather elaborated than invented
this method of cranial measurement. The artist even
seems to have entertained more philosophical views of
cephalometry, or head measurement, than the professor.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Various Early Craniologists.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The evolution of craniometrical measurements is of
interest to the physical anthropologist,
but even a brief recital of this progress
would weary the non-specialist. A history
of Anthropology would, however, not
be complete if it ignored the general trend of such investigations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the early workers, such as Daubenton (1716-99)
and Mulder, Walther, Barclay, and Serres in the
first half of the nineteenth century, attempted to express
the relation between the brain-case and the face by
some simple measurement or method of comparison in
their endeavour to formulate not only the differences
between the races of mankind, but also those which
obtain between men and the lower animals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Others during the same period investigated the relations
and proportions of portions of the skull to the
whole by means of lines. Spix (1815) adopted five lines.
Herder employed a series of lines radiating from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>atlas (the uppermost bone of the vertebral column);
but, more generally, the <i>meatus auditorius</i> (ear-hole)
was the starting-point (Doornik, 1815).</p>

<p class='c010'>The internal capacity of the skull first received attention
from Tiedemann (1836), who determined it by filling
the skull with millet seed and then ascertaining the
weight of the seed. Morton first used white pepper
seed, which he discarded later for No. 8 shot, while
Volkoff employed water. Modifications in the use of
these three media—seeds, shot, and water—are still
employed by craniologists.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most noteworthy names among the earlier workers
in craniology are those of Retzius and Grattan. Anders
Retzius (1796-1860) correlated the schemes of Blumenbach
and Camper, and so arrived at the methods of
craniological measurements which are almost universally
in use at the present day.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Cephalic Index of Retzius.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In 1840 he introduced his theory regarding cranial
shapes to the Academy of Science at Stockholm, and
two years later gave a course of lectures on the same
subject. He criticised the results attained by Blumenbach,
showing that his group contains varying types of
skull form; and he invented the cephalic
index, or length-breadth index—<i>i.e.</i>, the
ratio of the breadth of a skull to its
length, expressed as a per-centage. The
narrower skulls he termed dolichocephalic, the broader
ones brachycephalic. By this method Retzius designed
rather to arrange the forms of crania than to classify
thereby the races of mankind, though he tried to group
the European peoples more or less according to their
head-form. While thus elaborating the suggestion of
Blumenbach, he also recorded the degree of the projection
of the jaws, demonstrated by Camper, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>added the measurements of the face, height, and
jugular breadth. Thus was Craniology established on
its present lines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Grattan.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>John Grattan (1800-1871), the Belfast apothecary,
has never received the recognition
that was his due. Having undertaken
to describe the numerous ancient Irish
skulls collected by his friend Edmund Getty, he soon
became impressed by the absence of</p>
<p class='c023'>that uniformity of method and that numerical precision
without which no scientific investigation requiring the
co-operation of numerous observers can be successfully
prosecuted. The mode of procedure hitherto adopted
furnishes to the mind nothing but vague generalities ...
until we can record with something approaching towards
accuracy the proportional development of the great subdivisions
of the brain, as indicated by its bony covering,
and by our figures convey to the mind determinate ideas
of the relation they bear towards each other, we shall not
be in a position to do justice to our materials.... No
single cranium can <i>per se</i> be taken to represent the
true average characteristics of the variety from which it
may be derived. It is only from a large deduction that
the ethnologist can venture to pronounce with confidence
upon the normal type of any race.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c019'>Grattan devised a series of radial measurements from
the <i>meatus auditorius</i>, and constructed an ingenious
craniometer. As Professor J. Symington points out,
“Grattan’s work was almost cotemporaneous with that
of Anders Retzius, and nearly all of it was done before
the German and French Schools had elaborated their
schemes of skull measurements.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a> He adopted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>most useful of the measurements then existing, and
added new ones of his own devising.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The distinguished American physician and physiologist
Dr. J. Aitken Meigs laid down the principles
that “Cranial measurements to be of practical use
should be both absolute and relative. Absolute measurements
are necessary to demonstrate those
anatomical differences between the crania of different
races which assume a great zoological significance in
proportion to their constancy. By relative measurements
of the head we obtain an approximate idea of
the peculiar physiological character of the enclosed brain
... the craniographer, in fact, becomes the cranioscopist”
(1861, p. 857). In this paper Meigs gives
craniometrical directions, some of which were designed
to give measurements for portions of the brain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Broca.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In France the greatest names are those of Broca,
Topinard, and de Quatrefages. Pierre Paul Broca
(1824-1880) was first destined for the army, but when
the death of his sister left him the only
child he was unwilling to leave his
parents, and resolved to study medicine
and share the work of his father, an eminent physician.
He soon distinguished himself, especially in surgery,
not only in practical work, but also in his writings. With
regard to the latter, Dr. Pozzi, in a memoir, says of
him: “There is hardly one of the subjects in which he
did not at the first stroke make a discovery, great or
small; there is not one on which he has not left the
mark of his originality.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c018'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In 1847 he was appointed to serve on a Commission to
report on some excavations in the cemetery of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Celestins, and this led him to study craniology, and
thence to ethnology, in which his interest, once aroused,
never flagged. The story of the formation of the
<i>Société d’anthropologie de Paris</i> (1859) and of <i>l’École</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>d’anthropologie</i> (1876), of both of which Broca was the
moving spirit, affords a curious commentary on the suspicion
in which Anthropology was held. To the success
of the School he devoted all his energies, and during
many years of anxiety he met and overcame all obstacles,
surmounted all difficulties, wore down all opposition,
and finally placed it in a secure position. He
invented several instruments for the more accurate
study of craniology, such as the occipital crochet,
goniometer, and stereograph, and also standardised
methods; but, dissatisfied with the inconclusiveness
of mere cranial comparisons, he turned towards the
end of his life to the study of the brain. He was an
indefatigable worker, and his sudden death in his fifty-sixth
year is attributed to cerebral exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Broca was a man,” said Dr. Beddoe, “who positively
radiated science and the love of science; no one
could associate with him without catching a portion of
the sacred flame. Topinard has been the Elisha of this
Elijah.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c018'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Paul Topinard, pupil, colleague, and friend of Broca,
made valuable investigations on the

devoting much time to anthropometrical
studies; but his greatest service has been the preparation
and publication of <i>l’Anthropologie</i> (1876), a guide
for students and a manual of reference for travellers
and others, voicing the idea of Broca and his school,
and “elucidating in a single volume a series of vast
dimensions, in process of rapid development.” In 1885
he published his classic <i>Eléments d’anthropologie
générale</i>,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c018'><sup>[25]</sup></a> which aimed at creating a new atmosphere for

<div class='sidenote'><b>De Quatrefages.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau (1810-92) was not
only a distinguished zoologist, occupying himself mainly
with certain groups of marine animals, but also
Professor of Anthropology at the Paris
Museum of Natural History, and undertook
several voyages along the coasts of
the Mediterranean and the Atlantic in search of information.
In 1867 he published <i>Rapport sur le progrès de
l’Anthropologie</i>, “which reduces to a complete and
intelligible system the abstruse and difficult, and, to
many, the incomprehensible science of anthropology,
embracing during his investigations a wide range of
topics, and arranging disjointed facts in due order, so
as at once to evince their bearing upon the subject.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c018'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
He published many other works, among them <i>Les
Pygmées</i> (1887), <i>L’espèce humaine</i> (1877), <i>Histoire
générale des races humaines</i> (1889), and, together with
E. T. Hamy, the famous <i>Crania ethnica</i> (1875-79).

<p class='c021'>A man of strong convictions and very conservative,
de Quatrefages was ever ready to hear the other side,
and ever candid and kindly in argument. He was one of
the first to support the Society of Anthropology. Those
who know the story of the early days of that great
association understand what that means. When the
claim for man’s antiquity was generally derided, de
Quatrefages championed the cause. A monogenist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>[p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>], a believer in the extreme antiquity of our race, he
was never won over by any of the proposed theories of

lived happily and busily active among his books and

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Virchow.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In Germany the greatest name is that of Virchow.
Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow (1821-1902) had already
gained fame in the medical world, especially
with regard to histology, pathology,
and the study of epidemics, and was the
prime leader in the “<i>Medizinische Reform</i>” movement
before he began his valuable contributions to the
science of Anthropology.</p>

<p class='c010'>His first anthropological writings were some papers
on cretinism (1851 and 1852), and from this date
onwards his services to the science can scarcely be over-estimated.
Much of his energy was also given to
somatic anthropology, and in 1866 he started his
investigations into prehistoric archæology, combining
scientific method with spade-work.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a notice of his work by Oscar Israel<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c018'><sup>[27]</sup></a> (p. 656) we

</div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Virchow devoted himself to ethnographic studies no less
than to other branches of anthropology, and here he
became a center to which the material streamed from all
sides, and from which went forth suggestion, criticism,
and energetic assistance. This never-idle man did not
disdain to teach travelers schooled in other lines of
investigation the anthropometric methods; and, indeed,
he found time for everything, and never left a piece of
work to others that he could possibly do himself. Thus,
for example, for ten years following its inception by him
in 1876, he worked up alone the data recorded in German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>schools as to the color of the eyes, the hair, and the
skin which has proved of such value for the knowledge
of the different branches of the German race.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Sergi.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Professor Sergi at one time proposed to banish
measurements from craniology, and to
rely solely on observational methods.
He has later modified his extreme position,
while, as a result of his crusade, he has induced
most anthropologists to pay more attention to the configuration
of the skull, and some of his descriptive
terms have come into common use.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Hagen’s Criticism of Craniometry.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hagen relates the extreme specialisation into
which craniologists were led:—</p>

<p class='c021'>A rage for skull measurements, vast, vigorous, and
heedless, set in on all sides, especially after
Lucae had discovered and perfected a method
of accurately representing the irregular form
of the object studied. “More skulls” was
henceforth the war-cry; the trunk, extremities,
soft tissues, skin and hair, might all go by the board,
being counted of no scientific value whatever. Anthropologists,
or those who aspired to the title, measured and
delineated skulls; museums became veritable cities of
skulls, and the reputation of a scientific traveller almost
stood or fell with the number of crania which he brought
back with him.</p>

<p class='c024'>After two decades of measuring and collecting ever
greater quantities of material from foreign lands, and
from the so-called primitive or aboriginal races, the
inadequacy of Retzius’s method became apparent. Far
too many intermediate forms were met with, which it
was found absolutely impossible to classify by its means.
In accordance with the suggestion of the French anthropologist
Broca, and of Welcker, Professor of Anatomy at
Halle, a third type, the so-called Mesocephalic form, was
interposed between the two forms recognised by Retzius.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Even this did not suffice, however. In the face of the
infinite variety of form of the crania now massed together,
a variety only comparable to that of leaves in a forest,
this primitively simple scheme, with its four and finally
six types, failed through lack of elasticity. Then began
complication extending ever further and further. Attention
was no longer confined to the length and breadth,
but also to the height of the cranium, high and low (or
flat) skulls—<i>i.e.</i>, hypsicephalic and chamaecephalic
varieties being recognised. The facial part of the skull
was examined not only from the side, with a view to
recording the straightness or obliquity of the profile, but
also from the front; and there were thus distinguished
long, medium, and short faces, and also broad and
narrow facial types. The nasal skeleton, the palate, the
orbit, the teeth, and the mandible were investigated in
turn, and at last all the individual bones of the cranium
and face, their irregularities of outline, and their relations
to one another, were subjected to the closest examination
and most subtle measurements, with instruments of
extreme delicacy of construction and ingenuity of design,
till, finally, the trifling number of five thousand measurements
for every skull found an advocate in the person of
the Hungarian Professor V. Török (whereby the wealth
of detail obscured the main objects of study); while, on
the other hand, observers deviated into scientific jugglery,
like that of the Italian Professor Sergi, who contrived to
recognise within the limits of a single small archipelago,
the D’Entrecasteaux group of islets near New Guinea, as
many as eleven cranial varieties, which were all distinguished
by high-sounding descriptive names, such as
<i>Lophocephalus brachyclitometopus</i>, etc.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Despite all the labour that has been bestowed on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>subject, craniometric literature is at present
as unsatisfactory as it is dull. Hitherto
observations have been concentrated on
cranial measurements as methods for the
discrimination of the skulls of different races.
Scores of lines, arcs, chords, and indexes
have been devised for this purpose, and the diagnosis
of skulls has been attempted by a process as mechanical
as that whereby we identify certain issues of postage-stamps
by counting the nicks in the margin. But there
is underlying all these no unifying hypothesis; so that
when we, in our sesquipedalian jargon, describe an
Australian skull as microcephalic, phænozygous, tapeino-dolichocephalic,
prognathic, platyrhine, hypselopalatine,
leptostaphyline, dolichuranic, chamaeprosopic, and microseme,
we are no nearer to the formulation of any philosophic
concept of the general principles which have led
to the assumption of these characters by the cranium in
question, and we are forced to echo the apostrophe of
Von Török, “Vanity, thy name is Craniology.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is significant that so many of the earlier craniologists
recognised that the really important problem
before them was to gain a knowledge of the size and
relative proportions of the various regions of the brain,
this being a direct result of the phrenological studies
then so much in vogue. When phrenology became
discredited, this aspect of craniometry was largely
neglected; but recently it has exhibited signs of
a healthy revival, and the inner surface of the
cranium is now regarded as more instructive than the
outer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though for a time craniology was hailed as the
magic formula by which alone all ethnological tangles
could be unravelled, measurements of other parts of the
body were not ignored by those who recognised that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>one measurement was sufficient to determine racial
affinities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Anthropometry.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Thus Anthropometry began to map out definite lines
of research, and detailed studies were
made of arms and legs, hands and feet,
curves and angles, brains and viscera;
while, shorn of its extravagant claims,
craniology took its legitimate place as one in a series
of bodily measurements. One of the earliest workers
in measurements other than that of the skull was
Charles White (1728-1813).</p>

<p class='c010'>His contribution to Somatology was a series of
measurements on arms; and he discovered that the
fore-arm of the Negro is longer, in comparison with his
upper-arm, than that of the European, and that that of
the Ape is relatively longer than that of the Negro. On
account of these measurements on the living (no less
than fifty Negroes were measured), White has been
claimed as the founder of Anthropometry. Soemmerring
(1755-1830), however, had made use of measurements
in his comparison of the anatomy of the Negro
with the European.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Measurements and Observations of Living Populations.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>About the middle of the nineteenth century observations
on the living were made, in addition to Anthropometry;
investigations were undertaken,
not of the skulls and bones of the dead,
or even of the head-forms and body-measurements
of the living, but of the
forms of such features as the nose and
ear, pigmentation of the skin and eyes,
and the like. As early as 1834 L. R. Villermé had
started investigations on the various classes of the
population of Great Britain, comparing the dwellers in
the country with those of manufacturing districts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>large cities, mainly in the interests of hygiene; and
later he examined the size and health of children
working in coal-mines.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1861 the venerated Dr. John Beddoe published a
study of hair and eye colour in Ireland, and he has
continued his researches in this fruitful field from time
to time in various parts of the British Isles, and to a less
extent on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it was on the continent that this method of
investigation was most ardently prosecuted; and the
story of its political origin may here be briefly recounted,
since the results were of great service to the science of
Anthropometry.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the bombardment of Paris, in the Franco-Prussian
War, the Natural History Museum suffered
some damage through shells; and soon afterwards the
director, de Quatrefages, published a pamphlet on <i>La
Race Prussienne</i> (1871). This was to show that the
Prussians were not Teutonic at all, but were descended
from the Finns, who were classed with the Lapps as
alien Mongolian intruders into Europe. They were
thus mere barbarians, with a hatred of a culture they
could not appreciate; and their object in shelling the
museum was “to take from this Paris that they execrate,
from this Babylon that they curse, one of its elements
of superiority and attraction. Hence our collections
were doomed to perish.” A reply was made by Professor
Virchow, of Berlin, and the battle raged furiously.
The significance of this controversy to Anthropometry
lies in the fact that its immediate result was an order
from the German Government authorising an official census
of the colour of the hair and eyes of 6,000,000 school
children of the Empire—a census which served at once
as a stimulus to and a model for further investigators.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>This census had some amusing and unexpected results,
quoted by Dr. Tylor<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c018'><sup>[29]</sup></a> as illustrating the growth of
legends:—</p>

<div class='fn'>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pres. Add. Brit. Ass., 1879.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>No doubt many legends of the ancient world, though
not really history, are myths which have arisen by
reasoning on actual events, as definite as that which,
some four years ago, was terrifying the peasant mind
in North Germany, and especially in Posen. The report
had spread far and wide that all Catholic children with
black hair and blue eyes were to be sent out of the
country, some said to Russia; while others declared that
it was the King of Prussia who had been playing cards
with the Sultan of Turkey, and had staked and lost
40,000 fair-haired, blue-eyed children; and there were
Moors travelling about in covered carts to collect them;
and the schoolmasters were helping, for they were to
have five dollars for every child they handed over. For a
time popular excitement was quite serious; the parents
kept their children away from school and hid them,
and when they appeared in the streets of the market
town the little ones clung to them with terrified looks....
One schoolmaster, who evidently knew his people,
assured the terrified parents that it was only the children
with blue hair and green eyes that were wanted—an
explanation that sent them home quite comforted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Observations of external characters, combined with
precise measurements, have now been made on a large
scale in most European countries, and these methods
are adopted on anthropological expeditions. In this
way a great deal of valuable material for study has
been accumulated, but much work remains to be done
in this direction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Methods of Dealing with Anthropometric Data.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Not only have head, body, and limb measurements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>been recorded, but the device of an
“index” has been adopted which gives the
ratio between two measurements, as, for
example, in the previously-mentioned
cephalic index (p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>). The averages or
means of series of indices obtained from one people
have been compared with those obtained from other
peoples; but this method is misleading, as there is
frequently a very considerable range in any given series,
and a mean merely gives a colourless conception of
racial types, the only value of which is a ready standard
of comparison, which, however, is full of pitfalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>A further step in the advancement of anthropometric
research was made when the extent and frequency of
such deviations from the mean were recorded. At first
this was done in a tabular manner by means of seriations;
then curves were employed: a single peak was held to
indicate purity of race, double peaks that two racial
elements entered into the series measured, a broad
peak or plateau was interpreted as being due to race
fusion. Dr. C. S. Myers,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c018'><sup>[30]</sup></a> who has discussed these
and other methods, points out the fallacies of this
interpretation, saying: “There can be little doubt that
most of the many-peaked curves owe their irregularity
to the inadequate number of individual measurements
which have been taken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Myers emphatically states:—</p>

<p class='c021'>If physical anthropology is to be a science, its results
<i>must</i> be capable of expression in mathematical formulæ.
To this end some of the most interesting of biological
work of the age is tending ... generally speaking, the
study of living forms is passing from the descriptive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the quantitative aspect, and it is by experiment and
observation on biometrical lines that future progress is
clearly promised.... Thanks to the recent work of
Professor Karl Pearson, the proper start has at last been
made.</p>
<p class='c022'>His school is now attacking by statistical methods the
problem of the dependence of the variation of one
character upon that of another. It should be remembered
that Quetelet was the first to apply the Gaussian Law
of Error to human measurements in its elementary
binomial form; in this he was followed by Sir Francis
Galton, who was the first in this country to realise the
importance of applying mathematical methods to
anthropological measurements and observations. An
interesting account of the genesis of his work in this
direction is given in his <i>Memories of My Life</i> (1908).
Similar work has also been undertaken by German
investigators.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Scientific and Practical Value of Anthropometry.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>We may conclude this chapter with a brief summary
of the main lines which investigations
are now taking; but it is impossible to
mention even the more important of
recent workers in this vast field.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the beginning of the study,
anthropometry was employed as a precise
means of expressing the differences
between man and the lower animals; and, owing to
improved methods of research and the discovery of new
material, the origin and differentiation of man is still
investigated with assiduity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though no one measurement can be used for purposes
of race discrimination, yet a series of measurements on
a sufficiently large group of subjects, together with
observations on the colour of the skin, hair, and eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the form of various organs—such as the nose and ears—and
other comparisons of a similar nature, are invaluable
in the study of the races of mankind. It is
only in this way that the mixtures of the population
can be sorted out, their origins traced, and some idea
gained of the racial migrations which have taken place
since man first appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the initiative of Sir Francis Galton, as
Dr. Myers points out, anthropometry has begun to
investigate other problems which must ultimately be
of ethnological interest; and he has opened out the
whole subject of heredity, which eventually must enter
into every branch of physical anthropology. The followers
of Mendel are at present laying a foundation upon
their experiments with plants and animals. At present
very little attention has been paid by them to man; nor,
probably, can much be attempted until more precise data
are available.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lamentably little is known with accuracy about the
physical and psychical effects of the mixture of different
human types, and it is yet to be determined how far the
admitted unsatisfactory character of many half-caste
populations is due to physiological or sociological
causes.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a great dearth of sufficiently numerous
and reliable observations and statistics concerning the
effect of the environment upon small or large groups of
human beings—a problem to which Professor Ridgeway
devoted his last presidential address to the Royal
Anthropological Institute (1910).</p>

<p class='c010'>It is often important that the physical fitness of
people should be tested, in order to see how they stand
in relation to other people, and to discover any physical
imperfections. Especially is this desirable in the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of children; and the government inspection of school
children, though inadequate, is a step in the right
direction. By such means early inclinations to various
defects are discovered and prevented, and valuable
statistics are obtained which can not only be utilised
for comparative purposes, but may form a basis for
future legislation. It is also a matter of importance to
determine whether certain imperfections are due to
diseased, abnormal, or other undesirable factors in their
parentage; or whether they are the results of unfavourable
subsequent conditions. But in order that comparisons
can be made, it is necessary to make similar investigations
on the normal, capable, and healthy population.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another branch of investigation was undertaken mainly
for the identification of criminals, and consisted in certain
measurements selected by M. Alphonse Bertillon, supplemented
by photographs and a record of individual
peculiarities. The practical value of this method of
identification in France was demonstrated by its immediate
results. Criminals began to leave off aliases, and
numbers of them flocked to England. Finger-prints as
a means of identification were first discovered by
Purkenje, the Breslau physiologist (1823), who utilised
them for classification. Sir William Herschel, of the
Indian Civil Service, adopted the method in Bengal,
and now methods introduced by Sir Francis Galton are
in use in India, England, and elsewhere, having in most
cases supplanted the Bertillon system.</p>

    <div>ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONTROVERSIES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Next</span> to geographical discovery, perhaps the most
stimulating influence on Anthropology has been the
succession of controversies in which it has constantly
been involved. It has always been regarded as a somewhat
anarchical subject, advocating views which might
prove dangerous to Church and State; and many are
the battles which have raged within and without.
Huxley attributed the large audiences which were wont
to throng the Anthropological Section of the British
Association to the innate bellicose instincts of man, and
to the splendid opportunities afforded by Anthropology
for indulging those propensities.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c018'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The discussions of the earlier centuries were focussed
round the question of the origin of man, and from this
highly debateable problem arose the two antagonistic
groups of the monogenists, or orthodox school, deriving
all mankind from a single pair, and the polygenists,
who believed in a multiple origin. Before the discoveries
of prehistoric archæology had advanced sufficiently
to show the futility of such discussion, anthropologists
were split up into opposing camps by the
question of the fixity of species, and became embroiled
in one of the fiercest controversies of modern times—that
of evolution. A subordinate subject of contention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>implicated in the polygenist doctrines, was the place of
the Negro in nature, involving the question of slavery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Origin of Man.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Among the ancient philosophers the question of the
origin of man was answered in various
ways; some, like Pythagoras, Plato, and
Aristotle, believed that mankind had
always existed, because there never could have been a
beginning of things, relying on the scholastic argument
that no bird could be born without an egg, and no egg
without a bird. Epicurus and Lucretius believed in a
“fortuitous cause,” a preparation of fat and slimy
earth, with a long incubation of water and conjunction
of heavenly and planetary bodies. Others, that men
and animals “crawled out of the earth by chance,”
“like mushrooms or blite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With the spread of Christianity the Mosaic cosmogony
became generally adopted, and monogenism
developed into an article of faith. The Church fulminated
against those atheists who admitted doubts on
the subject of Adam and Eve, or believed in the existence
of antipodal man, or that man had existed for more
than the 6,000 years allotted to him by Scripture. If
the censure of the Church did not lead to recantation,
the heretic was burnt. A seventeenth-century divine,
Dr. Lightfoot, Vice-Chancellor of the University of
Cambridge, was even more precise than Archbishop
Ussher: he reached the conclusion that “man was
created by the Trinity on October 23, 4004 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, at
nine o’clock in the morning.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c018'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The discovery of the New World dealt a severe blow

Antipodal man, whom St. Augustine<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c018'><sup>[33]</sup></a> had extinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>as “excessively absurd,” was found to exist, and the
Spaniards forthwith excused their barbarities to the
American natives on the plea that they were not the
descendants of Adam and Eve.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Polygenism and Monogenism.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Henceforward the polygenists began to gain ground.
Theophrastus Paracelsus (1520) first
asserted the plurality of the races of mankind,
and explained the Mosaic cosmogony
as having been written “theologically—for
the weaker brethren.” Vanini (1616) mentions
a belief, entertained by atheists, that man was descended
from or allied to monkeys. In 1655 Isaac de la Peyrère,
a Calvinist scholar of Bordeaux, published in Amsterdam
his <i>Præ-Adamitæ</i>, to prove that Adam and Eve were
not the first human beings upon the earth; and his
work, being prohibited by authority, became immensely
popular.</p>

<p class='c010'>His theory, though unorthodox, was founded on
Scripture, and regarded Adam and Eve as merely a
special and much later creation; the Gentiles, who
peopled the rest of the earth, having been formed from
the dust of the earth, together with the beasts of the
field, on the sixth day. The inhabitants of the New
World, which, being separate from the Old, could
not have been peopled with the same race, were of
Gentile origin. This theory was bitterly opposed.
The <i>Parlement</i> of Paris caused the book to be
publicly burned. The Inquisition laid hands on the
author, and he was forced to abjure both his Pre-Adamite
heresy and his Calvinism. He died in a
convent in 1676.</p>

<p class='c010'>The writings of the Encyclopedists, the freedom of
thought claimed by Voltaire and Rousseau, together
with the classification of species by Linnæus, emboldened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the polygenists. Lord Kames<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c018'><sup>[34]</sup></a> was one of the earliest
exponents in England, and he soon found many
followers. Two separate lines of antagonism may be
distinguished in the controversy. In one—the Anglo-French—Prichard,
Cuvier, and de Quatrefages represent
the monogenists, and Virey and Bory de Saint-Vincent
the polygenists; the other, in which America and
the slavery question were implicated, polygenists and
anti-abolitionists going hand-in-hand, was represented
by Nott and Gliddon in America, Knox and Hunt in
England, and Broca in France.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Sketches on the History of Man</i>, 1774.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>When materials began to accumulate they were
detrimental to the polygenist theory. Especially was
this the case with regard to the proof of what Broca
termed “<i>eugenesis</i>”—<i>i.e.</i>, that all the <i>Hominidæ</i> are, and
always have been, fertile with each other. This, which
formed a test between species and varieties in Botany
and Zoology, was claimed also in Anthropology, and the
polygenists had to seek for support elsewhere. They
found it in Linguistics; “language as a test of race”
bulked large in ethnological controversy, and is not
yet entirely extinct.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first the monogenists claimed language as supporting
their views. All languages were to be traced to
three sources—Indo-European, Semitic, and Malay;
and these, in their turn, were the offspring of a parent
tongue, now entirely lost. But it was soon found
impossible to reconcile even Aryan and Semitic, and a
common parent for all three languages was inconceivable.
The linguistic argument then passed over to the
polygenists.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hovelacque stated that “the ascertained impossibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of reducing a multiplicity of linguistic families to a
common centre is for us sufficient proof of the original
plurality of the races that have been developed with
them.” M. Chavée<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c018'><sup>[35]</sup></a> went further. “We might,” he
says, “put Semitic children and Indo-European children
apart, who had been taught by deaf mutes, and we
should find that the former would naturally speak a
Semitic language, the latter an Aryan language.” F.
Müller and others took up this line of argument, holding
that distinct stock languages proved the existence
of distinct stock races. But, as Professor Keane points
out, in his summary of the controversy (1896, chap. vii.),
<i>quod nimis probat, nihil probat</i>—what proves too much,
proves nothing—and the hundred or more stock
languages in America alone, reduced the argument to
an absurdity.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Monogenists.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Among the monogenists may be included most of the
older anthropologists—Linnæus, Buffon,
Blumenbach, Camper, Prichard, and
Lawrence. Since they held that all
mankind was descended from a single pair (the question
as to whether this pair were white, black, or red,
occasioned a further discussion), they had to account
for the subsequent divergence producing the present
clearly-recognised varieties; and, in so doing, anticipated
the theory of evolution, which was not clearly
enunciated until the time of Lamarck.</p>

<p class='c010'>Linnæus believed in fixity of species, but had doubts
about the Biblical account. As a naturalist, he found
it difficult to credit the exceptional nature of a country
which had supplied the wants of zoological species as
opposed to one another as the polar bear and the tropical
hippopotamus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Buffon ascribed the variations of man to the influence
of climate and diet. Though Prichard and Lawrence
both denied the possibility of the transmission of
acquired characters, Prichard believed that the transmission
of occasional variations might, to some extent,
account for the diversities of races.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c018'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Lawrence wrote
more clearly: “Racial differences can be explained only
by two principles—namely, the occasional production of
an offspring with different characters from those of the
parents, as a native or congenital variety; and the
propagation of such varieties by generation.” He considered
that domestication favoured the production of
these congenital and transmissible variations, and,
anticipating the Eugenic school, deplored the fact that,
while so much care and attention was paid to the
breeding of domestic animals, the breeding of man
was left to the vagaries of his own individual fancy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Lawrence.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Sir William Lawrence (1783-1867) was appointed Professor
of Anatomy and Surgery to the
Royal College of Surgeons at the early
age of thirty-two. His lectures on
“Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, Zoology, and
the Natural History of Man,” delivered between 1816
and 1818, raised an immediate outcry; and the author
(to use his own words) was charged “with the
unworthy design of propagating opinions detrimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to society, and of endeavouring to enforce them for the
purpose of loosening those restraints in which the
welfare of mankind exists.” Lawrence was forced to
bow before the storm of abuse, and announce publicly
that the volumes had been suppressed, as he was
refused copyright. It is interesting to note that these
lectures are among those at present recommended for
the use of students of Anthropology.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lawrence was far in advance of his time, and much
of his teaching may be said to have anticipated the
doctrine of evolution. Unfortunately, the theological
protest raised by his lectures—published when he was
only thirty-five—resulted in his forsaking Anthropology
altogether, and he henceforward devoted himself entirely
to anatomy and surgery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Lord Monboddo.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Another prophet in advance of his times was Lord
Monboddo. James Burnett Monboddo (1714-1799)
was regarded as one of the most eccentric
characters of the eighteenth century,
mainly on account of his peculiar views
about the origin of society and of language, and his
theories as to the relationship of man with the monkeys.
He was deeply interested in all the current accounts of
“tailed men,” thus justifying Dr. Johnson’s remark that
he was “as jealous of his tail as a squirrel.” Later
students of his writings are less struck by these eccentricities,
which afforded endless jests to the wags of the
age, than by his scientific methods of investigation and
his acute conclusions. He not only studied man as one
of the animals, but he also studied savages with a view
to elucidating the origin of civilisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many other pre-Darwinian evolutionists might be
mentioned, but Professor Lovejoy’s caution must be
noted:—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The premature adoption of a hypothesis is a sin against
the scientific spirit; and the chance acceptance by some
enthusiast of a truth in which, at the time, he has no
sound reason for believing, by no means entitles him to
any place of honour in the history of science.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c018'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The first to enunciate a coherent theory of evolution—that
of Transformism or Transmutation—was
Lamarck.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c018'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>De Maillet and Robinet had already outlined part of the
Lamarckian doctrine.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Lamarck.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Lamarck (1744-1829) believed that species were not
fixed, but that the more complex were
developed from pre-existent simpler
forms. He attributed the change of
species mainly to physical conditions of life, to crossing,
and especially to use or disuse of organs, which not
only resulted in the modification, growth, or atrophy
of some, but, under the stress of necessity, led to the
formation of new ones. “<i>La fonction fait l’organe.</i>” He
also held that changes produced in the individual as the
result of environment were transmitted to the offspring.
Organic life was traced back and back to a small
number of primordial germs or monads, the offspring
of spontaneous generation. Man formed no exception.
He was the result of the slow transformation of certain
apes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lamarck’s views were first published in 1801, and
were enlarged in his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>, 1809.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Cuvier.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Lamarck’s chief opponent was Cuvier (1769-1832),
Professor of Natural History and of
Comparative Anatomy in Paris, who,
besides being the recognised authority
on zoology (his great book, <i>Le Règne Animal</i>, was long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the standard work on the subject), was even more
renowned as an anatomist. He upheld the theory of
Catastrophe, of alternate destructions and regenerations,
against the new theories of Transformism and
Evolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to this widely accepted belief, the universe
was subject to violent terrestrial revolutions, involving
the destruction of all existing things and the total
annihilation of all living beings belonging to the past
epoch.</p>

<p class='c010'>The theory was by no means new; it was current in
the East in the thirteenth century. In a book written
by Mohamed Kaswini on the wonders of nature, he tells
the following tale:—</p>

<p class='c021'>In passing one day by a very ancient and extremely
populous city, I asked of one of the inhabitants who
founded their city. He replied to me: “I know not, and
our ancestors knew no more than we do on this point.”
Five hundred years afterwards, passing by the same
place, I could not perceive a trace of the city. Inquiring
of one of the peasants about the place when it was that
the city was destroyed, he answered me: “What an odd
question you put to me; this country has never been
otherwise than as you see it now.” I returned there
after another five hundred years, and I found in the
place of the country I had seen—a sea. I now asked of
the fishermen how long it was since their country became
a sea; and he replied that a person like me ought to
know that it had always been a sea. I returned again
after five hundred years; the sea had disappeared, and it
was now dry land. No one knew what had become of
the sea, or if such a thing had ever existed. Finally, I
returned once more after five hundred years, and I again
found a flourishing city. The people told me that the
origin of their city was lost in the night of time.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c018'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Cuvier’s position was supported by the evidence
brought to France by Napoleon’s scientific expedition
to Egypt (1801). Here were seen numbers of mummified
animals, probably dating back some three to four
thousand years, but showing no appreciable difference
from existing types. This was held to demolish the
theory of evolution by proving the immutability of
species.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Étienne Saint-Hilaire.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Étienne Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844), the zoologist
on the Egyptian expedition, interpreted
the results differently, and was
one of the most brilliant supporters of
Lamarck. In 1828 he published his
convictions that the same forms have not been perpetuated
since the origin of all things, though he did
not believe that existing species were undergoing modification.
Cuvier returned to the charge, and in 1856
propounded his doctrine of the periodical revolutions of
the earth, of the renewal each time of the flora and
fauna, and of the incessant and miraculous intervention
of a creative Will. And for a time, owing to his position
and authority, he held the field.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Robert Chambers.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In 1844 appeared a book which had an enormous
influence on the pre-Darwinian history of
Evolution. This was an anonymous work
entitled <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of
Creation</i>, the authorship of which was not revealed until
the publication of the twelfth edition in 1884. It was
the production of Robert Chambers (1802-1871), co-editor
with his brother William of <i>Chambers’s Journal</i>,
and author of many books on Scotland and a few on
science. He traced the action of general laws throughout
the universe as a system of growth and development,
and held that the various species of animals and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>plants had been produced in orderly succession from
each other by the action of unknown laws and the
influence of external conditions. The <i>Vestiges</i> became
at once the centre of scientific discussion, denounced by
the orthodox, and held “not proven” by most of the
men of science of the time. Its supporters were called
“Vestigiarian,” a term which implied also “unscientific,”
“sentimental,” and “absurd.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The curious point is that in the <i>Vestiges</i> we find much
of what was subsequently called the Darwinian theory
already enunciated. According to Wallace, it clearly
formulated the conception of evolution through natural
laws, and yet it was denounced by those who soon
after were to become the champions of Darwinism.
This was partly due to the way in which the doctrine
was treated and expressed, partly also to the “needless
savagery” of Professor Huxley.</p>

<p class='c010'>Huxley wrote in 1887: “I must have read the <i>Vestiges</i>
... before 1846; but, if I did, the book made very little
impression on me.... I confess the book simply irritated
me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly unscientific
habit of mind manifested by the writer.”
Professor Lovejoy<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c018'><sup>[40]</sup></a> explains the reasons for Huxley’s
attitude:—</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r40'>40</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Loc. cit.</i></p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The truth is that Huxley’s strongly emotional and
highly pugnacious nature was held back by certain wholly
non-logical influences from accepting an hypothesis for
which the evidence was practically as potent for over
a decade before he accepted it as it was at the time of his
conversion. The book was written in a somewhat
exuberant and rhetorical style. With all its religious
heterodoxy, it was characterised by a certain pious and
edifying tone, and was given to abrupt transitions from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>scientific reasoning to mystical sentiment. It contained
numerous blunders in matters of biological and geological
detail; and its author inclined to believe, on the basis of
some rather absurd experimental evidence, in the possibility
of spontaneous generation. All these things were
offensive to the professional standards of an enthusiastic
young naturalist, scrupulous about the rigour of the
game, intolerant of vagueness and of any mixture of the
romantic imagination with scientific inquiry.... He
therefore, in 1854, almost outdid the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
in the ferocity of his onslaught upon the layman who had
ventured to put forward sweeping generalisations upon
biological questions while capable of errors upon particular
points which were palpable to every competent specialist.</p>

<p class='c014'>Huxley refers to this review as “the only review I ever
have had qualms of conscience about, on the grounds
of needless savagery.” Darwin more mildly described
it as “rather hard on the poor author.” Indeed, he
confessed to a certain sympathy with the <i>Vestiges</i>; while
Wallace, in 1845, expressed a very favourable opinion
of the book, describing it as “an ingenious hypothesis,
strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The strongest testimony to the value of Chambers’s
work is that of Mr. A. W. Benn, who writes in <i>Modern
England</i>, 1908, concerning the <i>Vestiges</i>:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Hardly any advance has since been made on Chambers’s
general arguments, which at the time they appeared
would have been accepted as convincing, but for theological
truculence and scientific timidity. And Chambers
himself only gave unity to thoughts already in wide
circulation.... Chambers was not a scientific expert,
nor altogether an original thinker; but he had studied
scientific literature to better purpose than any professor....
The considerations that now recommend evolution
to popular audiences are no other than those urged in the
<i>Vestiges</i>.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Herbert Spencer.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The next great name among the pre-Darwinian
evolutionists is that of Herbert
Spencer. About 1850 he wrote:—</p>

<p class='c021'>The belief in organic evolution had taken deep root (in
my mind), and drawn to itself a large amount of evidence—evidence
not derived from numerous special instances,
but derived from the general aspects of organic nature
and from the necessity of accepting the hypothesis of
evolution when the hypothesis of special creation had been
rejected. The special creation belief had dropped out of
my mind many years before, and I could not remain in
a suspended state: acceptance of the only possible
alternative was imperative.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c018'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This suspended state, the <i>tätige Skepsis</i> of Goethe, was
just what Huxley was enjoying; in his own words,
“Reversing the apostolic precept to be all things to all
men, I usually defended the tenability of received
doctrines, when I had to do with the transmutationists;
and stood up for the possibility of transmutation among
the orthodox.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, up to the date of the publication of the <i>Origin
of Species</i>, scientific opinion was roughly divided into
two opposing camps: on one side were the classic,
orthodox, catastrophic, or creationist party, who believed
in the fixity of species, and that each species was the
result of special miraculous creation; on the other, the
evolutionists or transmutationists, who rejected special
creation, and held that all species were derived from
other species, by some unknown law.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the formulation of this unknown law that
makes 1859 an epoch in the history of Anthropology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Charles Darwin.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Darwin’s work may best be summed up in the words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of his loyal and self-effacing co-worker,
Alfred Russel Wallace:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Before Darwin’s work appeared the great
majority of naturalists, and almost without exception the
whole literary and scientific world, held firmly to the belief
that species were realities, and had not been derived from
other species by any process accessible to us ... [but]
by some totally unknown process so far removed from
ordinary reproduction that it was usually spoken of as
“special creation.”... But now all this is changed. The
whole scientific and literary world, even the whole
educated public, accepts, as a matter of common knowledge,
the origin of species from other allied species by
the ordinary process of natural birth. The idea of special
creation or any altogether exceptional mode of production
is absolutely extinct.... And this vast, this totally unprecedented,
change in public opinion has been the result
of the work of one man, and was brought about in the
short space of twenty years.</p>

<p class='c014'>Huxley describes the attitude towards the theory in
the year following the publication of the <i>Origin of
Species</i>: “In the year 1860 there was nothing more
volcanic, more shocking, more subversive of everything
right and proper, than to put forward the proposition
that, as far as physical organisation is concerned, there
is less difference between man and the highest apes
than there is between the highest apes and the lowest....
That question was not a pleasant one to handle.”
But the “horrible paradoxes of one generation became
the commonplaces of schoolboys”; and the “startling
proposition” of 1860 was, twenty years later, a “fact
that no rational man could dispute.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c018'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This question of the difference between man and the
apes was embittered by the personal encounter between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Huxley and Owen. Professor Owen, in 1857, stated that
the <i>hippocampus minor</i>, which characterises the hind
lobe in each hemisphere in the human brain, is peculiar
to the genus <i>Homo</i>. This Huxley denied;<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c018'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and, as
neither disputant would acknowledge that he was mistaken,
the question became “one of personal veracity.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>As a possible explanation of this famous dispute, it
is interesting to note the discovery announced by Professor
D. J. Cunningham of the absence of this cavity
on one side of the brain of an orang-utan, with the suggestion
that Owen “may in the first instance have been
misled by an abnormal brain of this kind.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c018'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The further history of the development, expansion,
and curtailment of the Darwinian theory as such lies
beyond the scope of this little book. The criticisms of
sexual selection and of the origin of the higher mental
characters of man by Wallace; the denial of the
inheritability of acquired characters by August Weismann
and others; the orthogenesis theory of Theodore
Eimer, the “mutation” theory of Hugo de Vries and
Mendel’s researches—all opened up lively controversies,
and the field of science is still clouded with the
smoke of their battles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ferment provoked by the publication of Darwin’s
<i>Origin of Species</i> profoundly affected, as was natural,
the nascent science of Anthropology. At the meeting
of the British Association in Nottingham in 1866 Dr.
James Hunt read an address before the Anthropological
Department to show that “the recent application of
Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis of ‘natural selection’ to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>anthropology by some of Mr. Darwin’s disciples is
wholly unwarranted either by logic or by facts.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c018'><sup>[45]</sup></a> In
this address he said that he still believed the deduction
he had made three years previously—“that there is as
good reason for classifying the negro as a distinct.
species from the European as there is for making the
ass a distinct species from the zebra; and if, in classification,
we take intelligence into consideration, there
is a far greater difference between the negro and the
European than between the gorilla and chimpanzee.”
He insisted that “anthropologists are bound to take
the totality of the characteristics of the different types
of man into consideration. “It is to be regretted,
however,” Dr. Hunt continues, “that there are many
writers in Germany who have recently written as
though the question of man’s place in nature were
settled”; but he is delighted to find that “Professor
Carl Vogt is doing all he can to show the fallacy
of the unity hypothesis.” He quotes Professor Vogt
as saying: “This much is certain, that each of these
anthropoid apes has its peculiar characters by which it
approaches man.... If, in the different regions of the
globe, anthropoid apes may issue from different stocks,
we cannot see why these different stocks should be
denied further development into the human type, and
that only one stock should possess this privilege. The
further we go back in history the greater is the contrast
between individual types, the more opposed are the
characters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The controversies and discussions of this period were
not confined to those who had technical knowledge or
scientifically trained minds. All sorts of people joined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in the fray, mainly because they fancied that the new
ideas were subversive of “revealed religion”; but it
would serve no useful purpose to recall the false statements
and bitter expressions that were bandied about.
Some had merely a sentimental objection to the doctrine
of evolution; but at the present day most people would
subscribe to the declaration of Broca, who wrote:
“Quant à moi, je trouve plus de gloire à monter qu’à
descendre et si j’admettais l’intervention des impressions
sentimentales dans les sciences, je dirais que j’aimerais
mieux être un singe perfectionné qu’un Adam
dégénéré.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c018'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>The Negro’s Place in Nature.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Another controversy, which, though mainly political
in origin, cleft the ranks of the anthropologists,
arose from the slavery question.
Clarkson had started his agitation for
the abolition of the slave trade about
1782, and during the early years of the nineteenth
century many unsuccessful attempts were made to
bring the system to an end in America. In 1826 over
a hundred anti-slavery societies were in existence,
mainly in the middle belt of the States, while the Cotton
States were equally unanimous and vehement in opposition.
Feeling naturally ran high; riots, murders,
lynchings, raids, and general lawlessness characterised
the agitation on both sides, and added fuel to the
flames which finally dissolved the Union in 1860. At
home the question was hotly debated, and popular
feeling was excited by the speeches of Clarkson and
Wilberforce, and, most of all, by the publication of
<i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> (1852). Being mainly a question of
race, Anthropology was soon implicated, monogenists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and polygenists naturally ranked themselves on opposite
sides, and the Ethnological Society became a strong
partisan of the philanthropists and abolitionists.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of the excitement James Hunt, Honorary
Fellow of the Ethnological Society and President of
the newly formed Anthropological Society, read (1863)
his paper on “The Negro’s Place in Nature.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c018'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In this
he carefully examined all the evidence on the subject,
physical and psychical, and arrived at the conclusion
that “the negro is intellectually inferior to the European,
and that the analogies are far more numerous
between the ape and negro than between the ape and
the European”; moreover, that “the negro becomes
more humanised when in his natural subordination to
the European than under any other circumstances,”
“that the negro race can only be humanised and
civilised by Europeans,” and “that European civilisation
is not suited to the negro’s requirements or character.”
An abstract of the paper was read by Dr.
Hunt at the meeting of the British Association at
Newcastle, 1863, where the presence of an eloquent
coloured speaker enlivened the subsequent discussion.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c018'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
A tremendous outcry greeted the publication of this
paper, and tightened the tension on the already strained
relations between the two societies. Fierce denunciations
from Exeter Hall and the “broad-brimmed school
of philanthropists” were matched by equally vehement
applause from the opposing camp. When Dr. Hunt
died, a few years later, the following obituary notice,
extracted from a New York paper, appeared in the

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>We are pained to hear of the death of Dr. James Hunt,
beyond doubt the best, or at all events the most useful,
man in England, if not, indeed, in Europe. The man
that leads all other men in knowledge essential to human
well-being, that thus extends the bounds of human
happiness, and best illustrates the wisdom and beneficence
of the Almighty Creator to His creatures, is, <i>per
se</i> and of necessity, the best man of his generation; and
such a man was the late Dr. James Hunt of England....
Dr.  Hunt, in his own clear knowledge and brave
enthusiasm, was doing more for humanity, for the
welfare of mankind, and for the glory of God, than all
the philosophers, humanitarians, philanthropists, statesmen,
and, we may say, bishops and clergy of England
together.... His death at the early age of thirty-six is a
great loss to England, to Christendom, to all mankind;
for, though there are many others labouring in the same
great cause, especially in France and Germany, there was
no European of this generation so clear and profound in
the science of humanity as Dr. Hunt.</p>

<p class='c014'>A serious discussion of the anatomical and psychological
relation of the negro to the European is still to
the fore, especially in the United States of North
America. But even as late as 1900 a book was
published in America with the following title, and we
have been informed that it has had a very large sale in
the Southern States:—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Negro a Beast</span>; or, “<span class='sc'>In the Image of God</span>.”
<i>The Reasoner of the Age, the Revelator of the Century!
The Bible as it is! The Negro and His Relation to the
Human Family!</i> The Negro a beast, but created with
articulate speech, and hands, that he may be of service
to his master—the White man. <i>The Negro not the Son
of Ham</i>, neither can it be proven by the Bible, and the
argument of the theologian who would claim such, melts
to mist before the thunderous and convincing arguments
of this masterful book. By Charles Carroll, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>spent fifteen years of his life and $20,000.00 in its compilation.
Published by American Book and Bible House,
St. Louis, Mo., 1900.</p>

<p class='c014'>The publishers are “convinced that when this book
is read ... it will be to the minds of the American
people like unto the voice of God from the clouds
appealing unto Paul on his way to Damascus.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This preposterous book could appeal only to the
ignorant and bigoted, and we mention it merely as an
extreme instance of the difficulties against which science
has sometimes to contend when dealing with burning
social questions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The latest word on this subject is by Professor F.
Boas, who believes that the negro in his physical and
mental make-up is not similar to the European. “There
is, however, no proof whatever that these differences
signify any appreciable degree of inferiority of the
negro ... for these racial differences are much less than
the range of variation found in either race considered
by itself.... The anatomy of the American negro is not
well known; and, notwithstanding the oft-repeated
assertions regarding the hereditary inferiority of the
mulatto, we know hardly anything on the subject.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c018'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
The real problem in America is the mulatto, since “the
conditions are such that the persistence of the pure
negro type is practically impossible.”</p>

    <div>THE UNFOLDING OF THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Fossil Man.</b></div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Ignorance</span> and prejudice combined to assert that man
was created a few thousand years ago in
a state of physical perfection. The possibility
of the discovery of fossil man
was therefore inconceivable to most people, and those
earlier writers who entertained the idea were generally
inclined to deny it. Cuvier, limiting the age of the
earth to the orthodox 6,000 years, had stated that fossil
bones of man did not exist. Moreover, up to the time
of his death (1832) nothing had been found to disturb
this generally received opinion.</p>
<p class='c010'>More than a hundred years before (1726) Professor
Scheuchzer, of Zürich, had discovered his famous
“<i>Homo diluvii testis</i>”—“Man, witness of the Flood”—and
had described it as a “rare relic of the accursed
race of the primitive world,” exclaiming piously:
“Melancholy skeleton of an old sinner, convert the
hearts of modern reprobates!” His fossil was proved
later to be that of a gigantic salamander, and
fossil man was allowed to sleep for more than a
century.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the question was again raised, in the middle of
the nineteenth century, evidence of human remains
which had been hitherto disregarded assumed a new
importance, and earlier finds were re-examined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Cannstadt.</b> Neanderthal.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>First there was the Cannstadt cranium, found in
1700 by Duke Eberhard of Würtemberg,
which remained undescribed for 135 years
in the Stuttgart Museum. Later it was
claimed as belonging to the prehistoric “race,” proofs
of whose existence were so rapidly accumulating. In
1856 a fresh stimulus was given by the discovery of a
cranium and some other remains in the
Feldhofen Cave, at the entrance to a
small ravine called Neanderthal, on the
right bank of the river Düssel, in Rhenish Prussia.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the first discovery of remains of palæolithic
man to receive serious attention. The skeleton was
embedded in a hard, consolidated loam, but unfortunately
was badly damaged by the workmen before it
was extricated. By the intervention of Fuhlrott, the
thigh bones, the upper bone of each arm, shoulder-blade,
collar-bone, some fragments of ribs and the
cranium, were rescued, and are now in the Rheinische-Antiquitäts’
Museum at Bonn. When the remains were
first exhibited by their discoverer at Bonn, doubts were
freely expressed as to their human character. Virchow
pronounced his opinion that the cranium was diseased;
in the long controversy which raged over this skull his
wide pathological experience, his distrust of merely
morphological considerations, his agnostic position
with regard to the origin of species in general and of
man in particular, led him, perhaps, to propound this
extreme view. Broca declared it to be normal. Huxley
recognised the skull as human, but declared it to be
the most ape-like ever discovered; and he placed it
below the Australian in type.</p>

<p class='c010'>No absolute reliance could, however, be placed on
the evidence of a single skull, and an imperfect one at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>that; but later discoveries served in the main to confirm
Huxley’s opinion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Spy.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Another important find was that of two crania and
other skeletal remains discovered in 1886
at Spy, in the Namur district, Belgium,
by de Puydt and Lohest,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c018'><sup>[51]</sup></a> with an
associated fauna which included the woolly rhinoceros,
mammoth, cave bear, hyæna, etc., five out of the nine
species being extinct.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Other Finds.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Since 1886 new discoveries of human remains have
been made at short intervals in various
parts of Europe, and these range in date
from historic to prehistoric times, the
oldest skulls having naturally the most interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very careful studies of these remains that have
been made by numerous anatomists are of extreme
interest to students, and their general conclusions will
be found summarised in certain text-books; but the
details are of a somewhat technical character. Suffice
it to say that even as far back as the palæolithic period,
when men used only chipped stone implements, there
were several human varieties in Europe; and, though
in their anatomical characters they were in some respects
more animal-like than existing Europeans, they were
scarcely more so than certain non-European races of
the present day—such, for example, as the Australian.
In all cases the skulls were unmistakably those of true
men, but on the whole it may be said that the points
in which they differed from more recent Europeans
betrayed “lower” characters.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order that the reader may appreciate what rapid
progress is now being made in this direction, we give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>brief account of the most recent discoveries of fossil
man.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Homo Heidelbergensis.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In October, 1907, a lower jaw was found in a deposit
of sand at Mauer, near Heidelberg. The
teeth are typically human; but the chinless
jaw, with its thick body, very broad
and short ascending portion, and other
special points, surpasses in its combination of primitive
characters all known recent and ancient human jaws,
thus it is a generalised type from which they can readily
be derived. It has been suggested that, as the jaw is
neither distinctly human nor anthropoid, it is a survival
from that remote ancestor from which there branched
off on the one side the genus Homo, and on the other
the genera of anthropoid apes. Dr. O. Schoetensack
regards <i>Homo Heidelbergensis</i> as of early Pleistocene or
late Pliocene age; but Dr. E. Werth<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c018'><sup>[52]</sup></a> relegates it to
the middle of the Ice Age.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Homo Primigenius.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In March, 1908, Herr Otto Hauser found a skeleton
of a young man in the upper valley of
the Vézère, Dordogne; the skull had a
receding forehead, prominent jaws, and
large orbits, surmounted by massive brow-ridges; the
limbs were short. It was a distinct burial with associated
objects which prove it to be of Mousterian age
(p. 75, <i>n.</i> 2).</p>

<p class='c010'>Also of Mousterian age are the skeleton discovered
in August, 1908,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c018'><sup>[53]</sup></a> and the skull in February, 1909, at
La Chapelle-aux-Saints, Corrèze, and the skeleton
exhumed in September in the latter year at Ferrassie,
Dordogne, by M. Peyrony, who had previously discovered
another skeleton of the same age at Peche de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>l’Azé, near Sarlat, also in Dordogne. These two finds
have not yet been described.</p>

<p class='c010'>Compared with the short stature (5ft. 3in.) of the
La Chapelle man, the skull is of remarkably large size.
It is narrow, with a flattened cranial vault and enormous
brow-ridges; the orbits are large, and the face is very

in regarding this skull as belonging to the
Neanderthal-Spy type, and considers that the group is
distinct from all other human groups, living or fossil.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c018'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>As Professor Sollas points out, “the primitive inhabitants
of France were distinguished from the highest
civilized races, not by a smaller, but by a larger, cranial
capacity; in other words, as we proceed backwards in
time the human brain increases in volume.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c018'><sup>[55]</sup></a> We
know that they buried their dead, and in some cases
provided weapons and food for use in a future state.
Their inventiveness is proved by the variety and
gradual improvement in the technique of their tools
and weapons. Their carvings in the round or low
relief, their spirited engravings on bone and ivory, and
their wonderful mural paintings, whether in outline,
shaded monochrome, or polychrome, evince an astonishing
æsthetic sense and technical skill.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the diggers in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece,
Crete, and elsewhere, have proved that civilisation was
far more ancient than could have been conceived even
fifty years ago, so the cave explorers have shown us
that during the latter half of the Palæolithic age there
lived mighty hunters, skilful artists, big-brained men,
who laid the foundations upon which subsequent
generations have built. This, then, is the lesson that
the latest results of investigations into the antiquity of
man has taught us—that brain, not brawn, has been
the essential factor in the evolution of man. The
human brain had developed at a greater rate than the
body, which even then retained unmistakable evidence
of man’s lowly origin. How long had this evolution been
progressing before Mousterian times?<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c018'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The ruder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>stone implements of the Acheulian and Chellian epochs
carry us an appreciable time backward; and if even
some of the eoliths are artifacts, we can project tool-using
man to yet earlier times. Then the record becomes
blurred, as it is manifestly impossible to decide whether
simple bruising of stones was caused by man or natural
agencies.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Pithecanthropus erectus.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>But these investigations all fade into relative insignificance
compared with the sensation caused
by the discovery made by Dr. Dubois in
Java in 1891. Dr. Eugene Dubois was
a graduate of Leyden University who,
besides having some knowledge of geology and palæontology,
had attained distinction in anatomy. Between
1890 and 1896 he was stationed in Java, as surgeon to
the Dutch Indian army, and by order of the Government
he conducted some explorations with a view to
determining the fossil fauna which had been discovered
in those parts many years before. While examining
the beds attributed to the Pleistocene period below the
dry season level of the Bengawan River, at Trinil, he
found the teeth, calvarium, and femur of the now world-famous
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>. This was announced
even in scientific journals as “The ‘Missing Link’
found at last.” Dubois published his account in Java
in 1894, and since that date a vast amount of literature
has accumulated round the subject, representing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>three antagonistic points of view. Some, like Virchow,
Krause, Waldeyer, Ranke, Bumüller, Hamann, and
Ten Kate, claim a simian origin for the remains;
Turner, Cunningham, Keith, Lydekker, Rudolf Martin,
and Topinard believed them to be human; while
Dubois, Manouvrier, Marsh, Haeckel, Nehring,
Verneau, Schwalbe, Klaatsch, and Duckworth ascribe
them to an intermediate form. The last-mentioned sums
up the evidence in these words: “I believe that in
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> we possess the nearest likeness
yet found of the human ancestor, at a stage immediately
antecedent to the definitely human phase, and yet at
the same time in advance of the simian stage.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c018'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The lowest term of the human series yet discovered is represented
by Pithecanthropus, and dates from some part of the
Pleistocene epoch” (W. J. Sollas, <i>Science Progress</i>, 1908, p. 353).
See also W. Volz, <i>Neues Jahrb. f. Mineral.</i>, 1907.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The English, as Dr. Dubois somewhat slyly noted,
claimed the remains as human; while the Germans
declared them to be simian; he himself, as a Dutchman,
assigned them to a mixture of both.</p>

<p class='c010'>The geological horizon in which the remains of
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> were discovered is still an open
question. Of late opinion seems to tend towards
regarding it as belonging to the early Pleistocene
instead of the Pliocene, to which it was at first
referred.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c018'><sup>[58]</sup></a> After reviewing all the evidence concerning
Tertiary man, Professor Sollas concludes:—“We have
now reached the end of this summary, and find ourselves
precisely where we were, having obtained no evidence
either for or against the existence of man in times
previous to the great Ice Age” (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 350).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r58'>58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The terms Magdalenian, Solutrian, Aurignacian, Mousterian,
Acheulian, Chellian, refer to various epochs of culture in
Palæolithic times, giving their sequence from the newest to the
most ancient. These epochs are further sub-divided by some
investigators, and several, if not all of them, are connected by
intermediate stages. In other words, the remains prove that a
steady evolution in culture has taken place. Nowhere do all
these layers occur in one locality, and the evidence of their
order is a matter of stratigraphy (<i>i.e.</i>, it is essentially a geological
method). Palæontology decides on the animal remains found in
the beds. The human anatomist discusses the human remains,
and the archæologist deals with the artifacts or objects made
by man. The accurate determination of the order of the beds
is obviously of fundamental importance.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The discovery of these human remains has had a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>noticeable effect on anthropometry. Most of them are
imperfect, some very much so; as in the case, for
example, of the partial calvaria of Pithecanthropus and
of the Neanderthal specimen. The remains are of such
intense interest that they stimulated anatomists to a
more careful analysis and comparison with other human
skulls and with those of anthropoids. As time rolled
on, new ways of looking at the problems suggested
themselves, which led to the employment of more
elaborate methods of measurement or description.
Almost every specimen of fossil man has led to some
improvement in technical research; and the subject is
not yet exhausted, as the character of the inner walls
of the crania have not yet yielded all their secrets, more
particularly in regard to the brains which they once
protected. It would be tedious to enumerate the
names of those who have studied even the two calvaria
just mentioned, and impossible to record all of those
who have advanced our knowledge of the anatomy of
fossil man.</p>

    <div>COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>At</span> the present time the data for a comparison of the
bodily functions of the members of one race with those
of another are so scanty that the science of ethnical
physiology can scarcely be said to exist. Fortunately,
there is a quite different state of affairs for the study of
the mind—or Psychology—though even in this field
there is yet a great deal of work to be done.</p>
<p class='c010'>During the eighteenth century the term “Anthropology,”
which was very vaguely employed, was often
used to designate a comprehensive psychology dealing
with the entire mental side of man, as well as the relations
between soul and body. Later, as its scope became
widened, the centre of gravity shifted over to physical
man; but anthropologists have always maintained their
right to deal also more or less with psychology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Phrenology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Psychology in early times concerned itself with the
essence of the soul as an independent entity, its relations
to the body, its destructibility or indestructibility,
and the laws of its operations. The word “Psychology”
has always had a vague and varying significance. Thus,
when Hunt, in his presidential address before the Anthropological
Society in 1866, says: “I am
glad to know that there are many Fellows
of this Society who are at present working
on the psychological aspects of our science,” he referred
to the interest then taken by the members in the phrenology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of the period. Later on, however, he expresses
his opinion with regard to “modern phrenology” as
being “wholly unscientific.” The old phrenology is
now practically dead.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Psychical Research.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>During the last quarter of the last century a study of
various obscure mental states received a
fresh impetus in this country by the
founding of the Society for Psychical
Research. This society principally investigates (1)
hypnotism, disorders of personality, automatic writing,
and crystal-gazing, which are universally recognised by
psychologists as furnishing fields for scientific study;
and (2) thought-transference and its manifestations,
which are not, however, at present generally accepted
as facts.</p>

<p class='c021'>Though but recently crept forth, <i>vix aut ne vix quidem</i>,
from the chill shade of scientific disdain, Anthropology
adopts the airs of her elder sisters among the sciences,
and is as severe as they to the Cinderella of the family,
Psychical Research. She must murmur of her fairies
among the cinders of the hearth, while they go forth to
the ball, and dance with provincial mayors at the festivities
of the British Association.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c018'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The hypnotic and kindred practices of the lower races
have until lately scarcely attracted the attention of
anthropologists. Bastian in 1890 wrote a tract, <i>Ueber
psychische Beobachtungen bei Naturvölkern</i>, and Tylor has
also touched on the subject in <i>Primitive Culture</i>; but its
main advocate is Andrew Lang, who declares: “Anthropology
must remain incomplete while it neglects this
field, whether among wild or civilised men,” and “In
the course of time this will come to be acknowledged.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Methods and Aims.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>If we turn now from popular to scientific notions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>psychology, we discern the following methods and aims
of the science. There are two methods—(1)
the introspective, by which one’s own
mental states are observed; and (2) the
objective, by which the conduct of others is observed:
both may be studied without or under experimental
conditions. It is very difficult to secure reliable introspection
in backward peoples, and also to interpret the
mental state of an individual by observing his behaviour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The objects of psychology are five-fold:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The study of mind compared with non-mental

<p class='c010'>All these are of interest and value for Anthropology,
especially the second, fourth, and fifth.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the earlier days of psychology, when the subject
was in the leading-strings of philosophy, it had little
ethnological value. Indeed, the possibility of such a
subject as ethnological psychology was not realised.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Ethnical Psychology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Ethnical psychology, the study of the mind of other
races and peoples, of which, among the
more backward races, glimpses can be
obtained only by living among them and
endeavouring to reach their point of view by means of
observation and experiment, is a modern conception;
and for this branch of the subject there is no history.</p>

<p class='c010'>As an illustration of the change of attitude with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>regard to ethnical psychology during the last fifty years,
we may quote from Burmeister<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c018'><sup>[60]</sup></a> in 1853: “It is not
worth while to look into the soul of the negro. It is a
judgment of God which is being executed that, at the
approach of civilisation, the savage man must perish”;
and again,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c018'><sup>[61]</sup></a> in 1857: “I have often tried to obtain an
insight into the mind of the negro, but it was never
worth the trouble.” Compare with this such works as
R. E. Dennett’s <i>At the Back of the Black Man’s Mind</i>,
1906. In justification of his attempt to represent the
basal ideas of the West African native, Dennett says:
“I cannot help feeling that one who has lived so long
among the Africans, and who has acquired a kind of
way of thinking black, should be listened to on the off-chance
that a secondary instinct, developed by long
contact with the people he is writing about, may have
driven him to a right, or very nearly right, conclusion”
(pp. 133-4). And as the keynote of his elaborate
investigation, which results in “crediting the Africans
with thoughts, concerning their religious and political
system, comparable to any that may have been handed
down” to ourselves by our own ancestors, he quotes
from Flora L. Shaw<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c018'><sup>[62]</sup></a>: “It may happen that we shall
have to revise entirely our view of the black races, and
regard those who now exist as the decadent representatives
of an almost forgotten era, rather than as the
embryonic possibility of an era yet to come.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Folk Psychology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Adolf Bastian (1826-1905), after passing through five
universities—Heidelberg, Berlin, Jena,
Wurzburg, and Prague—began his life
of travel in 1851 as a ship’s doctor. The
next twenty-five years were mainly spent in voyages of
research in all parts of the world, and always with one
object in view—the collection of materials for a comparative
psychology, on the principles of a natural
science. His first journey, which occupied eight years,
resulted in the publication in 1860 of the first of a long
series of writings. When not engaged in travel, his
life was filled with his work in connection with the
Berlin Museums. Great though these services were,
Bastian’s main interest was always concentrated on
psychology. The ideas of folk psychology were in the
air, and the study of <i>Welt-Anschauung</i>, or, to use
Bastian’s phrase, <i>Völker-Gedanken</i>, was
already inaugurated in Germany. To
organise this study by introducing wide
scientific, inductive, and comparative methods, and to
collect evidence from among all the peoples of the earth,
was Bastian’s life-work, in which he was still engaged
when death overtook him at Trinidad in 1905. Among
the conceptions of the <i>Natur-Völker</i>—the “cryptograms
of mankind,” as he called them—he worked unceasingly,
demonstrating first the surprising uniformity of
outlook on the part of the more primitive peoples, and
secondly the correlation of differences of conceptions
with differences in material surroundings, varying with
geographical conditions. This second doctrine he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>elaborated in his <i>Zur Lehre von den Geographischen
Provinzen</i>, in 1886.</p>

<p class='c010'>The term “psychology of peoples” has become
familiar of late, and books have been written on the
psychology of special peoples, such as the <i>Esquisse
psychologique des Peuples Européens</i> (1903), by A.
Fouillée; but these are based on general considerations,
and not on experimental evidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The place of Comparative Psychology in Anthropology
was officially determined in this country by the request
which the Anthropological Institute made to Herbert
Spencer in 1875, to map out the Comparative Psychology
of Man, with a view to providing some sort of method
in handling the various questions that came before the
Institute. The result of this was Spencer’s provisional
Scheme of Character, in which the problem of measurement
took an important place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Experimental Psychology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In the department of experimental psychology Germany
again took the lead. G. T.
Fechner<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c018'><sup>[63]</sup></a> attempted by means of laboratory
tests to discover the law of connection
between psychical and bodily events.
A band of workers arose, and the new science spread
to other countries. In our country Sir Francis Galton
took advantage of the International Health Exhibition
at London, 1884, to install in the exhibition an anthropometric
laboratory, in which a few psychological
experiments were made on a large number of people,
and since then he has frequently made arrangements
for similar laboratories.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In nearly all of the larger universities Experimental
Psychology is a recognised study, and almost every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>variety of mental condition is investigated. Professor
W. Wundt, in his <i>Völkerpsychologie</i> (1904), has been a
master-builder on these foundations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiments in psychological laboratories were
of necessity confined to subjects readily accessible, who
naturally were mainly Europeans or of European
descent. A few observations had been made on aliens
who, as a rule, had been brought from their native
countries for show purposes; but in these cases the
observations were made under unfavourable conditions
so far as the subject was concerned. With the exception
of these very few and unsatisfactory investigations,
experimental psychology was mainly concerned
with the subjects numbered 2, 3, and 5 in the table
on p. 81.</p>

<p class='c010'>A new departure was made in 1898 by the Cambridge
Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits. For the
first time trained experimental psychologists (Drs.
W. H. R. Rivers, W. McDougall, and C. S. Myers)
investigated by means of an adequate laboratory
equipment a people in a low stage of culture under
their ordinary conditions of life. The foundations of
ethnical experimental psychology were thus laid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Professor R. W. Woodworth sums up the conclusions
arrived at from his own observations and those
of others as follows: “We are probably justified in
inferring that the sensory and motor processes and the
elementary brain activities, though differing in degree
from one individual to another, are about the same
from one race to another.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c018'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Lately an attempt has been made, under the auspices

in the field.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Eugenics.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>During the last few years the subject of race improvement,
or Eugenics, has been greatly to
the fore, and it has been in this country
mainly connected with the name of Sir
Francis Galton, who as long ago as 1865 published his
views on the subject. Eugenics is officially defined in
the Minutes of the University of London as “the study
of agencies under social control that may improve or
impair the racial qualities of future generations, either
physically or mentally.” A eugenics laboratory has
recently been established in University College, London,
in connection with Professor Karl Pearson’s biometric
laboratory.</p>

    <div>THE CLASSIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Race Description and Classification.</b></div>
<p class='c019'>After the age of race discrimination comes the age of
race description and classification; and,
as we should expect, this second stage is
not reached until the close of the Dark
Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance,
when thought had been emancipated from
the bondage of scholastic authority and stimulated by
the new impulse which infected all forms of intellectual
activity.</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Bernier.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The first attempt at the classification of mankind was
that of a French traveller, F. Bernier
(1625-1688), whose scheme appeared in
an anonymous article in the <i>Journal des
Scavans</i>, 1684, entitled “A new division of the earth,
according to the different species or races of men who
inhabit it,” etc.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c018'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r65'>65</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See T. Bendyshe, <i>Mem. Anth. Soc.</i>, I., 1865, p. 360.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>He distinguished “four or five species or races”:
(1) The inhabitants of Europe, North Africa (including
the Egyptians), and a great part of Asia (including the
Indians). He notes that the Egyptians and Indians are
black or copper-coloured, but considered the complexion
to be due to climate. (2) The Africans, with thick lips,
flat noses, and black skins, due not to climate but
nature, with scanty beard and woolly hair. (3) The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Asiatics not included in the first group, white, with
“broad shoulders, a flat face, a small squab nose, little
pig’s-eyes long and deep-set, and three hairs of beard.”
(4) The Lapps, “little stunted creatures, with thick legs,
large shoulders, short neck, and a face elongated
immensely; very ugly, and partaking much of the bear;
they are wretched animals.” He hesitates whether to
put the Americans or the inhabitants of South Africa,
who are unlike the Negroes, into a fifth class. The latter
are probably the Hottentots or Bushmen, in spite of his
statement that “some of the Dutch say they speak <i>turkey</i>.”</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Linnæus.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The next classification was that of Linnæus. His
service to Anthropology by fixing the
place of <i>Homo sapiens</i> in the animal
kingdom has already been noted (p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>).
In the first edition of the <i>Systema naturæ</i> (1735),<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c018'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Man
is classed as a quadruped, and together with the Ape
and Sloth constitutes the order <i>Anthropomorpha</i>. Four
varieties of Homo are recorded: <i>H. Europæus albesc.</i>,
<i>Americanus rubesc.</i>, <i>Asiaticus fuscus</i>, <i>Africanus nigr.</i>
In the second edition (1740) <i>Homo</i> is divided into the
same four varieties, which are distinguished by the
colour of their skin, located severally, one in each of
the then known continents—<i>Europæus albus</i>, <i>Americanus
rubescens</i>, <i>Asiaticus fuscus</i>, and <i>Africanus niger</i>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r66'>66</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These accounts have been taken from the original editions;
but the reader is referred to the verbatim copy given by Bendyshe
in the <i>Mem. Anth. Soc.</i>, I., 1865, p. 421.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>    In the tenth edition (1758) more divisions are recognised: the
genus Homo consists of two species—Sapiens, 1 H. diurnus.
<i>Ferus</i>, including hairy men without speech who run about on
all-fours, of which six records are given; <i>Americanus</i>
(α) and <i>Europæus</i>
(β), <i>Asiaticus</i>
(γ), <i>Afer</i>
(δ), <i>Monstrosus</i>
(ε), which include
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>(<i>a</i>) <i>Alpini</i> (small), <i>Patagonici</i> (large);
(<i>b</i>) <i>Monorchides</i>—Hottentotti, <i>Junceæ</i>—Europæ;
(<i>c</i>) <i>Macrocephali</i>—Chinenses,
<i>Plagiocephali</i>—Canadenses. A second
species being Troglodytes 2. H. nocturnus (Homo
sylvestris Orang-Outang). This classification was
retained in the twelfth edition (1772). In these two
latter editions the genera Simia, Lemur, and Vespertilio
were classed with Homo in the order Primates.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Fauna Suecica</i>, published in 1746, Linnæus made
a more detailed classification of the population of
Sweden, recognising three main types, distinguished
by their stature, hair, and eye colour. These were the
Goths, tall, hair white and straight, iris of the eyes
ashen blue; Finns, with muscular body, hair long and
yellow, and dark iris; and Lapps, with small, thin
body, straight black hair, and iris blackish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Blumenbach.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Blumenbach (1775) based his classification not only
on skin colour, but also on skull form.
To the four groups of Linnæus he added
a fifth, dividing the one species into five
varieties—the Caucasian, the Mongolian, the Ethiopian,
the American, and the Malayan. The last group
included the then little known Australian, Papuan, and
pure Malay types.</p>

<p class='c010'>Blumenbach was the originator of the unfortunate
title “Caucasian”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c018'><sup>[67]</sup></a> to represent the typical European
and the inhabitants of Eastern Asia and Northern Africa.
He chose the name partly because the Caucasus produces
the most beautiful race of men, and also on account
of the fine Georgian skull in his collection.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c018'><sup>[68]</sup></a> It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>unfortunate, since, as Ripley points out (1900, p. 436),
nowhere else in Europe is found such a heterogeneity of
physical types—the only one conspicuously missing being
the fair-haired, blue-eyed European—and such a diversity
of language, sixty-eight dialects being here jumbled
together, and only one possessed of (possibly) Aryan
origin. The name “Caucasian” has, therefore, not led
to clarification of ideas in the complex problem of
European ethnology. Keane (1899), however, supports
its use, saying: “Those who object to Caucasic are
apt to forget the vast field that has to be embraced by
this single collective term.” “Caucasic, when properly
understood ... cannot be dispensed with until a more
suitable general term be discovered” (p. 447).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Other Classifications.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The next important classification was that of Cuvier,
who derived mankind from the three sons
of Noah, Japhet being regarded as the
parent of the Caucasic, Shem of the
Mongolian, and Ham of the African races. The divergence
of type between the three brothers is not explained,
except that the blackness of the descendants of Ham
was attributed to the curse imposed by Noah on Canaan,
the son of Ham (Gen. ix. 25).</p>

<p class='c010'>Other classifications followed, the divisions varying
from two species, white and black, Virey (1801), to the
fifteen or sixteen of the Polygenists, Desmoulins (1825-6),
and Bory de Saint-Vincent (1827), and the thirty-four of
Haeckel (1873).</p>

<p class='c010'>In America L. Agassiz, an uncompromising opponent
of evolution, asserted, in 1845,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c018'><sup>[69]</sup></a> the unity of mankind
as a species; but in 1850<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c018'><sup>[70]</sup></a> we find him distribute eleven
or twelve, in 1853 (in Nott and Gliddon) eight, human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>species in as many geological and botanical provinces.
But this theory had been previously promulgated by
Desmoulins (1826) and by Swainson (in 1835).<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c018'><sup>[71]</sup></a> As
Waitz rightly says: “They are completely in error
who, adopting the views of Agassiz, assume as many
original types of mankind as there are typically different
peoples on the globe” (1864, p. 203).</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not until the nineteenth century that a really
scientific method of classification was adopted. In the
majority of these schemes the character of the hair was
chosen as the primary race-characteristic.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Pruner Bey.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The hair had already been studied by Heusinger
(1822), by Blower, of Philadelphia, and
by Kölliker, the histologist, before the
publication of Pruner Bey’s classic
memoir, read before the Paris Anthropological Society
in 1863, and published in the same year. Dr. Pruner
Bey claimed that the quality of the hair constituted one
of the best means of race-identification, and even that
“a single hair presenting the average form characteristic
of the race might serve to define it.”</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Bory de St. Vincent.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Long before this, in 1827, Bory de Saint-Vincent had
chosen the hair as the chief test in race-classification,
and divided mankind into
the <i>Leiotrichi</i>, or straight-haired, and
the <i>Ulotrichi</i>, or woolly-haired—a nomenclature afterwards
adopted by Professor Huxley (1870).<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c018'><sup>[72]</sup></a> But Bory
de Saint-Vincent’s classification was robbed of permanent
scientific value by his inclusion as distinct races
of such vague abstractions as “Scythians,” “Neptunians,”
and “Columbians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the earlier classifications were based on
insufficient or erroneous evidence, and the general
tendency has been to increase the divisions as the
physical characters of the populations of the earth
became gradually better known. Thus the twelve races
of Haeckel in 1873 had advanced to thirty-four in 1879;
the sixteen of Topinard in 1878 had grown to nineteen

As Flower himself says, this scheme of classification,
“in its broad outlines, scarcely differs from that proposed
by Cuvier nearly sixty years ago.... Still it can
only be looked upon as an approximation.” Although
he places skin-colour first, he tacitly admits its insufficiency
as a main diagnostic character, and his three
groups coincide with a classification based on the nature
of the hair.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Deniker.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Among the later classifications a new tendency may
be noted. The earlier schemes aimed at producing a
series of water-tight compartments into which the races
of the globe could be isolated. Further research, however,
encouraged the growing conviction that a pure
race is practically non-existent, and a different method
had to be followed. This is described by Deniker
(p. 284): “Taking into account all the
new data of anthropological science, I
endeavoured, as do the botanists, to
form natural groups by combining the different characters
(colour of the skin, nature of the hair, stature, form of
the head, of the nose, etc.).” This results in the formation
of seventeen ethnic groups, containing twenty-nine
races, and these are ingeniously arranged (p. 289) in
a two-dimensional grouping, to show their affinities,
which is a modification of his suggestive earlier scheme.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c018'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The “pigeon-hole” system of classification had, however,
been discredited in the fourth edition of Prichard’s
<i>Natural History of Man</i>, edited and enlarged by Edwin
Norris (1855), since on p. 644 it is stated:—</p>

<p class='c021'>The different races of men are not distinguished from
each other by strongly-marked, uniform, and permanent
distinctions, as are the several species belonging to any
given tribe of animals. All the diversities which exist
are variable, and pass into each other by insensible
gradations; and there is, moreover, scarcely an instance
in which the actual transition cannot be proved to have
taken place.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is practically the same result at which Waitz
arrived in 1863.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Keane.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Professor Keane (1895, p. 228), though returning
to the four-fold grouping proposed by
Linnæus, uses these divisions to represent,
not actual varieties or races, but “ideal
types,” differentiated by somatic characters, and also
by language, religion, and temperament. “Although
man had but one origin, one pliocene precursor [Pithecanthropus],
men had several separate places of origin,
several pleistocene precursors. In our family tree four
such precursors are assumed.” From each “ideal
type” he traces the development of the present varieties
arranged in the scheme of the family tree.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Man’s Place in Nature.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Since the time of Linnæus it has been recognised that
a place for man must be found in classification
of animals; and he was naturally
put at the top of the tree. The main
question, however, was his exact relationship to the
higher apes. Linnæus (p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>) included man and apes
in the Primates, one of his seven orders of Mammalia.
Cuvier divided the Mammifères into nine groups, man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>being included in the Bimanes, and apes and monkeys
in the Quadrumanes. The most noteworthy attempt to
put man in his place was made when Huxley published
his <i>Evidence as to Man’s Place in Nature</i> (1863), based on
lectures given in 1860, in which he proved that man was
more nearly allied to the higher apes than the latter were
to the lower monkeys. Concerning this book, he wrote
to Mr. E. Clodd, thirty years later, “that a very shrewd
friend of mine [Sir William Lawrence<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c018'><sup>[76]</sup></a>] implored me not
to publish, as it would certainly ruin all my prospects.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c018'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
Doubtless one reason why Huxley wrote the book was
to impress on the public that the evolution of man as an
animal is perfectly comparable with that of other mammals,
since Darwin only hinted in his <i>Origin of Species</i>
(1859) that “Light will be thrown on the origin of man
and his history” (p. 488). His silence, he confesses in
the Introduction to the <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871), was due
to desire “not to add to the prejudices against his
views.” Professor Haeckel fully discussed his views
concerning the genealogy of man in 1868,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c018'><sup>[78]</sup></a> and several
times subsequently.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r76'>76</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Preface to the 1894 edition Huxley writes: “It was
not so very long since my kind friend Sir William Lawrence, one
of the ablest men whom I have known, had been well-nigh ostracised
for his book <i>On Man</i>, which now might be read in a Sunday-school
without surprising anybody.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Vogt.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Carl Vogt (1864), who, like so many other zoologists
then and since, was led to study anthropology,
pointed out that “the ape-type does
not culminate in one, but in three, anthropoid
apes.” On examining the species of mankind and
their history, he arrived at similar results (see also p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the second volume of his <i>Generelle Morphologie</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>(1866) Haeckel applied the theory of evolution to
the whole organic kingdom, including man, and drew
up the first “genealogical trees.” This attempt was
improved and treated in a more popular form in his
<i>Natural History of Creation</i> (1868), and again in the
<i>Evolution of Man</i> (1879), an enlarged edition of which
was published in 1905.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is now a practical agreement among zoologists
and anthropologists that man is included in one of
several families that constitute the sub-order Anthropoidea
of the order Primates.</p>

<p class='c010'>As has previously been mentioned, the discovery of
<i>Pithecanthropus</i> raised great discussions, some of which
were concerning the exact position of man with regard
to the various higher apes. It is now generally
admitted that <i>Pithecanthropus</i> may be regarded as a
member of a separate family of the Anthropoidea, the
Pithecanthropidæ, between the Simiidæ and the Hominidæ.
The re-examination of the previously known
skulls of palæolithic age, and the discovery of fresh
specimens in recent years, have re-opened the question
whether the genus Homo contains more than the one
species, <i>H. Sapiens</i>. Duckworth<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c018'><sup>[79]</sup></a> (1904) has given a
careful summary of the morphological characters of the
Neanderthal, Spy, and Krapina remains, and states as
his opinion that “the individuals thus characterised are
associated in a group specifically distinct from the
modern Hominidæ, to which the name Homo primigenius
or Homo neanderthalensis has been applied.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c018'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Those authors who describe and classify the various
races and peoples of mankind at the same time indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>their geographical distribution, and in some instances
notify some of the shiftings and migrations that have
taken place. Many maps have been prepared to illustrate
the human distribution in whole or in part, and
these are to be found in various memoirs and books.
An atlas such as Dr. G. Gerland’s <i>Atlas der Völkerkunde</i>
(1892) summarises a vast amount of information.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our knowledge is very imperfect concerning the
movements of mankind. Historical records give some
information on the subject. A certain amount has been
gleaned from traditional sources, but doubtless much
more remains to be garnered. The spoils of the archæologist
afford important data, but there are immense
tracts of country which are yet totally unexplored, or
very imperfectly investigated. All shiftings of peoples
are mainly controlled by climatic and geographical conditions;
but these are continually varying, and it is the
business of the geographer and geologist to indicate
what these have probably been at various periods since
the appearance of man on this earth. It is not too
much to say that, when maps have been prepared which
indicate these various changes, great light will be
thrown upon the early history of mankind.</p>

    <div>ETHNOLOGY: ITS SCOPE AND SOURCES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Definition.</b></div>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Ethnology</span>” is a term which is often loosely used as
synonymous with “Anthropology,” to
cover the whole field of the science of
man. It was in this sense that it first
came into prominence, being chosen by M. W. F.
Edwards as the title for the <i>Société ethnologique de
Paris</i>, in 1839. The society was concerned with what
we should now call Anthropology; but it was more
especially interested in the origins and relationships of
the historical races of Europe, which was the etymological
justification for its name. The English Ethnological
Society, established in 1843, imitated the French
title, and did much to fix the vague and general interpretation
of the word. Unfortunately, Professor Tylor,
first and foremost of English ethnologists, seems purposely
to avoid the use of the word in his <i>Primitive
Culture</i>, which he refers to as “rational ethnography.”
But, with the development of the subject, its scope
became gradually more defined, until it is now generally
restricted to the comparative and genetic study of human
culture and of man as a social animal.</p>
<p class='c010'>The materials for the study of ethnology have been
always with us, but the study itself is of very recent
development, and almost alone among the sciences can
reckon its founders among the living. Professor
J. L. Myres gives excellent reasons for this “late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>adolescence” in his opening address at the meeting
of the British Association at Winnipeg, 1909:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Anthropology ... gathers its data from all longitudes,
and almost all latitudes, on this earth. It was necessary,
therefore, that the study of man should lag behind the
rest of the sciences, so long as any large masses of mankind
remained withdrawn from its view; and we have
only to remember that Australia and Africa were not even
crossed at all—much less explored—by white men, until
within living memory, to realise what this limitation
means. In addition to this, modern Western civilisation,
when it did at last come into contact with aboriginal
peoples in new continents, too often came, like the
religion which it professed, bringing “not peace, but a
sword.” The customs and institutions of alien people
have been viewed too often, even by reasonable and
good men, simply as “y<sup>e</sup> beastlie devices of y<sup>e</sup> heathen,”
and the pioneers of our culture, perversely mindful only
of the narrower creed, that “he that is not with us is
against us,” have set out to civilise savages by wrecking
the civilisation which they had (pp. 589-590).</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Sources.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>There are, as Professor Myres points out, two kinds
of anthropologists:—</p>

<p class='c021'>There is an anthropologist to whom we
go for our facts: the painful accurate
observer of data, the storehouse of infinite detail; sometimes
himself the traveller and explorer, by cunning
speech or wiser silence opening the secrets of aboriginal
hearts; sometimes the middleman, the broker of
traveller’s winnings, insatiate after some new thing,
unerring by instinct rather than by experience, to detect
false coin, to disinter the pearl of great price.... To him
we go for our facts....</p>

<p class='c024'>And there is an anthropologist to whom we look for
our light. His learning may be fragmentary, as some
men count learning; his memory faulty; his inaccuracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>beyond dispute; his inconsistency the one consistent
thing about him. But with shattered and ricketty
instruments he attains results; heedless of epicycles,
disrespectful to the equator, he bequeaths his paradoxes
to be demonstrated by another generation of men. He
may not know, or reason, perhaps; but he has learnt to
see; and what he sees he says (1908, p. 124).</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Herodotus.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In the earliest times Herodotus may be cited as one
of the most distinguished names in the
former of the two groups, and Lucretius
in the latter. The writings of Herodotus
(<i>circa</i> 480-425 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) are a veritable storehouse of information,
from the highest civilisations down to the
veriest savagery, and his work has lost none of its
freshness or value through lapse of time. As a matter
of fact, modern investigations carried out in the areas
treated of by him more frequently confirm and exemplify
than refute his statements.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Lucretius.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Lucretius (99 or 98-55 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), the poet, teacher, and
reformer, boldly declared that there was
no Golden Age from which man has
degenerated, but that his progress has
continually been slowly upward from a condition of pure
savagery:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Arms of old were hands nails and teeth and stones
and boughs broken off from the forests, and flame
and fire, as soon as they had become known. Afterwards
the force of iron and copper was discovered; and
the use of copper was known before that of iron, as its
nature is easier to work and it is found in greater
quantity. With copper they would labour the soil of the
earth, with copper stir up the billows of war.... Then by
slow steps the sword of iron gained ground and the
make of the copper sickle became a byword; and
with iron they began to plough through the earth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>soil, and the struggles of wavering war were rendered
equal.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c018'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote c000' id='f81'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r81'>81</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lucretius, <i>On the Nature of Things</i>. Translated by H. A. J.
Munro. Bohn’s edition, 1908, p. 214.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It is evident from his poems that Lucretius was a
keen observer and a philosopher, who summed up
existing Epicurean knowledge; and we are justified in
believing that these particular generalisations were
based upon tales told by travellers in distant lands, and
upon traditional lore, which, with the exception of the
recently acquired archæological evidence, is practically
all upon which we have to rely. The philosophic poet
apprehended the significance of various facts, and
welded them into a consistent theory of the development
of culture, and thereby earned the honour of being
the first evolutionary anthropologist.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Strabo.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Nor should we overlook the versatile Strabo (<i>circa</i> 63
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>-21 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), who was interested in many
things, from climate to botany, and from
sport to Druidism and Brahmanism.
Alexander von Humboldt considered that he surpassed
all other geographical labourers of antiquity by the
diversity of the subject and the grandeur of the composition.
His <i>Geography</i> contains much information
on the early history and traditions of numerous
peoples, their character, dress, dwellings, and mode of
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the writings of the earlier travellers (to mention
but three names)—Marco Polo, in Cathay (1254-1323),
Ibn Batuta (1304-1377), in Asia; and Joao de Barros
(1496-1570), who was considered the greatest authority
on Portuguese, African, and Asiatic travels of his time—and
in the records of travels contained in collections
such as those of Hakluyt (1552-1616), Purchas (1577-1626),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and Pinkerton (1758-1826), much ethnological
information can be sifted from among the marvellous
tales. Sometimes the marvellous tales themselves can,
by ethnology, be interpreted in fact, as when the “tailed
men” of the Nicobars are found to owe their origin to
the tail-like method of wearing the loin-cloth.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c018'><sup>[82]</sup></a> These
were followed by the travellers and explorers of the
nineteenth century, who brought back a vast amount
of new information, both physical and cultural, from the
lands they visited. Among these the names of Admiral
Byron, James Bruce, L. A. Bougainville, Sir John
Barrow, Captain Cook, de Lesseps, and Pallas may be
mentioned.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Other sources of information were the works of the
Jesuit missionaries of the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries, such as José d’Acosta (1539-1600), J. F.
Lafitau (1670-1740), and F. X. de Charlevoix (1682-1761),
who worked among the Canadian Indians, and
M. Dobrizhoffer (1717-1791).</p>

<p class='c010'>Next come the missionaries of the nineteenth century,
such as William Ellis (1794-1872), who laboured in
South Africa and Madagascar, but is best known for
his work in Polynesia; John Williams (1796-1839);
George Turner (1818-1891); W. Wyatt Gill (1828-1896),
and others who also worked in the Pacific. In
Africa we may mention Bishop Callaway (1817-1890)
and David Livingstone (1813-1873). At the same time
the Roman Catholic missionary E. R. Huc (1813-1860)
was working in China and Tartary, while the Abbé
Dubois (1770-1848) was laboriously investigating the
manners, customs, and ceremonies of the Hindus.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the missionaries, we owe a deep debt of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>gratitude to the early explorers and civil servants in all
parts of the world, who have provided, consciously or
unconsciously, a vast amount of information about the
peoples among whom they travelled or over whom they
ruled. Scientific expeditions, even before these were
undertaken in the interests of anthropology, collected
further material. Lastly come the various anthropological
expeditions, consisting of trained workers,
who, besides amassing fresh evidence, check, correct,
or amplify the work of earlier writers.</p>

<p class='c010'>These were the data on which the science of
Ethnology, in its restricted sense, was to be built.
The earliest ethnologists utilised the material mainly
with a view to elucidating ethnic relationships, and to
producing systematic classifications of the various races
of mankind. Later workers such as Ratzel and
Reclus produced systematic descriptions of races,
peoples, and areas. A third method was that of Tylor,
the chief exponent of Comparative Ethnology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Systematic Works on Ethnology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The earlier attempts at race classification were based
merely on physical characters, and are
dealt with elsewhere (Chap. VI.). During
the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth
centuries geographical discovery
brought a mass of new facts to light, especially in the
realm of natural history; and in no branch of that
science were the effects so marked as in that of Anthropology.</p>

<p class='c010'>The marshalling of a vast array of new observations
and deductions required a broad mind, wide knowledge,
and shrewd reasoning powers. These, together with
a sound training in anatomy, an unusual acquaintance
with philology, and some eminence in psychology, produced
the monumental work of Prichard.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Prichard.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>James Cowles Prichard (1786-1848) showed, when a
boy, a remarkable aptness for foreign
languages. He was never sent to school,
but was taught by various tutors, from
whom he learnt Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and
Spanish. His father, a merchant, and member of the
Society of Friends, lived for a time in Bristol, and there
the boy began his practical study of anthropology,
spending his time by the docks, watching the foreign
sailors, and chatting with them in their own tongues.
Later on he chose medicine for his profession, less on
account of any special liking for it than because it
afforded him opportunities for indulging his anthropological
tastes. His first contribution to the science was
his thesis for the degree of Doctor of Medicine in the
University of Edinburgh, which was entitled <i>De generis
humani varietate</i>, published in 1813 in an expanded
form as <i>Researches into the Physical History of Man</i>.
It was still further expanded in 1826, and a five-volume
edition was issued between 1836 and 1847. In 1843
appeared another monumental work, <i>The Natural
History of Man</i>, “comprising inquiries into the modifying
influence of physical and moral agencies on the
different tribes of the human family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Speaking of Prichard at the meeting of the British
Association in Bristol in 1875, Professor Rolleston
remarked: “His works remain, massive, impressive,
enduring—much as the headlands along our southern
coast stand out in the distance in their own grand outlines,
while a close and minute inspection is necessary
for the discernment of the forts and fosses added to
them—indeed, dug out of their substance in recent
times.” The services of Prichard in the field of
Anthropology have often been compared with those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>his contemporary Blumenbach, by whose fame during
his lifetime he was overshadowed; but, though the
latter was unequalled on the side of physical anthropology,
there is no doubt that Prichard had a wider
grasp of the subject, and his works formed the cornerstones
of Anthropology in England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Other Generalisations.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>While Prichard was expanding his thesis, Antoine
Desmoulins was writing his <i>Histoire
naturelle des races humaines</i>, which appeared
contemporaneously with Prichard’s
revised <i>Researches</i> in 1826. He attempted to discover
the origins and relations of the peoples of north-east
Europe, north and east Asia, and South Africa, by the
evidence of archæology, physiology, anatomy, and
linguistics.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work of systematising the mass of anthropological
data and producing an orderly scheme must
always be regarded as an almost superhuman task, and
those who have attempted it deserve our grateful
recognition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next Englishman after Prichard was Latham,
who published his <i>Natural History of the Varieties of
Man</i> in 1850 (the same year as Knox’s <i>Races of Man</i>),
and his <i>Descriptive Ethnology</i> in 1859. In the latter
year appeared the first instalment of the <i>Anthropologie
der Naturvölker</i> of Waitz, the six volumes of which
were completed in 1872—a work which largely assisted
in laying a secure foundation for the new science. In
1873 Friedrich Müller published his <i>Allgemeine Ethnographie</i>.
The following year saw the publication of
Peschel’s <i>Völkerkunde</i>. Ratzel’s great work, <i>Völkerkunde</i>,
appeared in 1885-88. In America Pickering’s
<i>Races of Man</i> was published in 1848, and Nott and
Gliddon’s <i>Indigenous Races of the Earth</i> in 1857. Paul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Topinard’s <i>L’Anthropologie</i> (1876) is mentioned elsewhere
(p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The earlier of these generalisations were composed
before the acceptance of the theory of evolution, in the
new light of which all biological sciences had to start
afresh, and all were written before the masses of new
material collected by ethnologists and archæologists,
working in the field, had brought so much fresh
evidence to bear upon the whole geographical and
historical aspect of man that it was impossible “to see
the wood for the trees.” Thus the time for synthesis
had arrived, and with the hour came the man. A. H.
Keane’s <i>Ethnology</i> appeared in 1896, to be followed by
his <i>Man, past and present</i> in 1899. J. Deniker’s <i>Les
races et les peuples de la terre</i>, together with the
English translation, appeared in the following year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Ethnology and the Classics.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In summarising the sources from which the materials
for the science of ethnology are derived,
stress must be laid on the contributions
from classic authors. No student can
afford to neglect the histories, annals,
poems, and sacred books of the ancients, whether
African, European, or Asiatic. Professor J. L. Myres
(1908) has pointed out that anthropological investigations
and speculations were already afoot in the fifth
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and before, and has outlined the ethnological
problems concerning man, his origin and
relationships, and the questions connected with his
social life that interested and puzzled the ancient
Greek world. Not only Herodotus, but other writers,
show that these problems were thoroughly familiar to
the Greeks. Long before Herodotus, Hesiod refers to
a standard scheme of archæology, in which Ages of
Gold, Silver, and Bronze succeed each other; primitive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>man is described as a forest dweller growing no corn,
but subsisting on acorns and beech mast; Anaximander
and Archelaus have suggestions to solve the
mystery of man’s origin, Anaximander taking an
“almost Darwinian outlook”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c018'><sup>[83]</sup></a> of the animal kingdom;
Æschylus distinguishes the tribes of men by culture,
noting the differences in their dress and equipments,
religious observances and language.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f83'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r83'>83</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This statement is criticised by E. E. Sikes in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, xx.,
1909, p. 424.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief value of the Greeks to the ethnologist is
that they were collectors of material. Some of their
theories have been substantiated, but they arrived at
conclusions by deduction rather than by induction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus in many ways anthropology owes a deep debt
of gratitude to the classics. It was not until recently
that this debt began to be repaid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within the last twenty or thirty years there has been
an increasing recognition of the value of anthropological
studies in the elucidation of the classics; and
this healthy movement is mainly associated with the
name of Professor William Ridgeway, of Cambridge,
who devoted his presidential address before the Royal
Anthropological Institute, in 1909, to this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1887 Professor Ridgeway proceeded to apply the
comparative method to Greek coins and weights in a
paper called the “Homeric Talent: Its Origin and
Affinities.”<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c018'><sup>[84]</sup></a> He there tried to show that the origin of
coined money among the Lydians, and its evolution by
the Greeks and Italians, entirely accorded with the
evolution of primitive money from the use of objects
such as axes, ornaments, cattle, and so forth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>One of the relations of Ethnology to other branches
of the Humanities which hitherto has received scant
acknowledgment is its influence on the course of
Political Science. Professor J. L. Myres recently gave
a brilliant address on this subject at Winnipeg, in which
he points out how Bodin (1530-1596), Edward Grimstone
(1615), Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), John Locke
(1632-1704), Montesquieu (1689-1755), Rousseau (1712-1778),
Voltaire (1694-1778), Herder (1744-1803), and
others, referred to or utilised the accounts of natives by
travellers to illustrate their theories of statecraft.</p>

    <div>THE HISTORY OF ARCHÆOLOGICAL DISCOVERY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Prehistoric Man.</b></div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Dr. Johnson</span> was not in advance of his time in
anthropological matters. While he was
gibing at Lord Monboddo for his belief
in man’s simian affinities, he was also
making a pronouncement on the subject of prehistoric
archæology that later discoveries were soon to disprove.
Up to his time history was content to start from the
earliest written documents, supplemented, now and
then, by the evidence of coins and inscriptions; and
Dr. Johnson summed up contemporary opinion in his
statement, “All that is really known of the ancient
state of Britain is contained in a few pages. We can
know no more than what old writers have told us.”</p>
<p class='c010'>But it was not long before it was recognised that
there was other evidence besides that of the “old
writers,” evidence the nature of which has been well
described by Sir W. R. Wilde:—</p>

<p class='c021'>We possess what cannot be falsified by the scribe, and,
although styled prehistoric, they are far more truthfully
historical than the writing that no doubt was largely
interfered with, and which, if old, now requires a gloss
to interpret it. The grassy mound or circle, the stones
erected into a cromleach, the great sepulchral mound,
the cinerary urn, the stone weapon or tool, the grain-rubber
for triturating cereal food, the harpoon for spearing
fish, the copper and bronze tools and weapons, and the
gold ornaments of the most early tribes—all are now, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>their way, far more truthful than anything that could
have been committed to writing, even if there were
letters in that day. They are litanies in stone, dogmata
in metal, and sermons preaching from the grassy mound.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c018'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r85'>85</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Brit. Ass., Belfast, 1874.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Much of this evidence already existed, but even when
rightly interpreted it was for a long time ignored and
scoffed at. It has been noted in the life-history of a
scientific truth, “People first say, ‘It is not true,’ then
that ‘It is contrary to religion,’ and lastly that ‘Everybody
knew it before.’” The first attitude of incredulity
was to a great extent justified by the doubtful character
of the earlier finds, many of which later investigation
has had to reject or to hold in suspense as “not
proven.” The second stage was more serious, and for
a long time the new science was hampered by the accusation
of irreligion. But “Anthropology,” as Huxley
pointed out, “has nothing to do with the truth or
falsehood of religion.” “<i>Je suis naturaliste</i>,” said
Abbé Bourgeois, “<i>je ne fais pas de théologie</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gradually the accumulated evidence became too
insistent to be ignored. The work of various archæologists
in Denmark, the explorations of caves and lake dwellings
in Britain and on the Continent, and the
patient labours of Boucher de Perthes in the Somme
Valley, all gave proof of the existence of prehistoric
man, and the science of prehistoric archæology was
established.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Flint Implements.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Long before this time, as far back as the sixteenth
century, flint implements had been discovered
in various parts, and proved as
great a puzzle as the fossils which
perplexed and tried the faith of the earlier geologists.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The uncultured folk of Europe recognised that the
chipped arrow-heads which occasionally occur on the
surface of the ground were the implements of an alien
people, as the names “elf darts” and “fairy darts”
imply. The country folk in the more backward districts
believe that fairies still exist; but better informed intelligent
people believe they are purely mythological,
while students are aware that these arrow-heads were
the implements of earlier populations, who are classed
in folk-memory under the generic term of “fairies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Typical neolithic implements, such as stone adze and
axe heads, had attracted the attention of writers in the
Middle Ages, such as Gesner and Agricola, who, as
Sir John Evans<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c018'><sup>[86]</sup></a> informs us, regarded them as thunder-bolts—a
belief which is still widely spread not only in
Europe, but over the greater portion of the Old World.
But Mercati, physician to Clement VIII. at the end of
the sixteenth century, appears to have been the first to
maintain that what were regarded as thunderbolts were
the arms of a primitive people unacquainted with the
use of bronze or iron. Certain later writers, as
de Boot (1636) and la Peyrère (1655), also regarded
them as of human workmanship. Buffon, too, in 1778,
declared the “thunder-stones” to be the work of
primeval man.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In 1797 John Frere found numerous flint implements at
a depth of about twelve feet in some clay pits at Hoxne,
Suffolk, and referred them to “a very remote period
indeed, even beyond that of the present world, and to a
people who had not the use of metals.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c018'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>But the discovery does not seem to have attracted
any interest, or raised any discussion; and the Hoxne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>implements lay unnoticed for more than half a century,
until Evans, returning from Amiens and Abbeville in
1859, recognised the importance of the collections, and
by further excavations proved their antiquity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The belief of the Middle Ages, that everything inexplicable
was the work of the Devil, was succeeded by
an ascription of all objects of unknown antiquity to the
Druids or the Romans; but to neither of these could
be attributed the finds which were being made at the
beginning of the nineteenth century in the Danish
kitchen-middens and dolmens, in the Swiss lake dwellings,
and in the caves and gravels of Britain and of
France. Still many years were to pass, and many
heated discussions were to be held, before archæology
came to be recognised as an ally of anthropology, and
Prehistoric Man obtained credence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Denmark.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In this new science Denmark took the lead. In 1806
a Commission was appointed to make a
scientific investigation into the history,
natural history, and geology of the
country; and among the first problems to be met with
were the dolmens and shell-mounds, abounding in stone
implements, which found no period in Danish history
capable of accommodating them. History and the sagas
were searched in vain. Meanwhile more and more
of these prehistoric implements were brought to light.
A new Commission was appointed, and the various sites
were carefully examined. The collection of Professor
R. Nyerup formed, in 1810, the nucleus which, in 1816,
expanded into the Royal Danish Museum of Antiquities
at Copenhagen, now, as the National Museum, lodged
in the Princessen Palace. C. J. Thomsen held the post
of curator from 1816 to 1865. He ordered, arranged,
and classified the collections, dividing the objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>according to their epoch of culture, and setting them in
chronological order, establishing the sequence of the
Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages. This was the first
attempt to classify the archæological contents of a
museum on a chronological basis, and it was continued,
elaborated, and developed by his successor, Professor
J. J. A. Worsaae, 1865 to 1885.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c018'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f88'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The classification itself was not new; it had been adumbrated
by many writers. See Evans, 1872, pp. 3 ff.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Caves.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Another class of evidence which was of great importance
in determining the pre-history of
man was that derived from the caves.
The beginnings of cave-exploration are
described by Professor Boyd Dawkins:—</p>

<p class='c021'>The dread of the supernatural, which preserved the
European caves from disturbance, was destroyed in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by the search after
“ebur fossile,” or unicorn’s horn, which ranked high in
the materia medica of those days as a specific for many
diseases, and which was obtained, in great abundance,
in the caverns of the Hartz, and in those of Hungary and
Franconia. As the true nature of the drug gradually
revealed itself, the German caves became famous for the
remains of the lions, hyænas, fossil elephants, and other
strange animals, which had been used for medicine.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c018'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote c000' id='f89'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Cave Hunting</i>, p. 11.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>These caves were investigated mainly by geologists or
palæontologists, searching for evidence as to the extinct
animals that formerly occupied them. Indications of
the presence of man were unsuspected, and, if found,
disregarded. Thus much of the evidence of man’s
early history was doubtless unwittingly destroyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Franconian caves were explored towards the end
of the eighteenth century, and described by Esper (1774),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Rosenmüller (1804), and Dr. Goldfuss (1810). The
most famous of these was the cave of Gailenreuth.
Here, for the first time, investigations were carried out
systematically, the finds classified, and, since they indicated
the co-existence of man and extinct mammals,
theories as to their significance and derivation filled the
air.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1861 William Buckland (1784-1856), Professor of
Mineralogy at Oxford (afterwards Dean of Westminster),
visited the caves, and kindled that interest in
cave-exploration which was to produce such remarkable
results in England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Oreston.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In the same year the first bone-cave systematically
explored in the country was discovered
at Oreston, near Plymouth, and the
deposits proved the former existence of
the rhinoceros in that region.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Kirkdale.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>More famous was the exploration of the Kirkdale
Cave, near Helmsley, in Yorkshire, discovered
in 1821, in a limestone quarry,
and investigated and described by Dr.
Buckland.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c018'><sup>[90]</sup></a> He found remains of the broken and
gnawed bones of the rhinoceros, mammoth, stag, bison,
etc., which had been the prey of the hyænas inhabiting
the cave, and he traced their origin to a universal
deluge. Subsequently he examined the remains from
other caves, and summarised his conclusions in
<i>Reliquiæ Diluvianæ</i>, published in 1824. Dr. Buckland
was henceforward the acknowledged authority on bone
caves and their contents, and to his disbelief in the
contemporaneous existence of man with the cave animals
may be traced much of the incredulity with which all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>evidence of early man in Britain was received for more
than a generation.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f90'>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>So far but few traces of man’s presence in the caves
had been detected, and, when found, had generally
been explained away as later intrusions, though human
occupations had been proved in Franconia, in the
French caves explored by MM. Tournai de Christol and
Marcel de Serres in the south of France in 1828, and
later by the discoveries of Dr. Schmerling in the caves
of Liège about 1832.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Liège.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>From the forty caves examined Dr. Schmerling found
not only bones of extinct animals, but
also a few human bones, and a large
number of bone and flint implements and
flakes, which he attributed to human workmanship.
Unfortunately, these discoveries were discredited both
by Dr. Buckland and Sir Charles Lyell, but have since
been fully substantiated by Dr. E. Dupont.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c018'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Kent’s Cavern.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The most important of all the cave explorations in
England is that of Kent’s Cavern, Torquay.
This cavern was known from time
immemorial; but the first investigation
recorded was that of Mr. Northmore, of Cleeve, Exeter,
who visited it in 1824, in expectation of finding evidence
of the worship of Mithras.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year he returned there again, accompanied
by the Rev. J. MacEnery, the Roman Catholic chaplain
at Tor Abbey, whose name will always be honourably
connected with the explorations of the cave. He was
not a geologist or a palæontologist, but to him fell
the distinction of discovering the first flint implement
ever found in unmistakable association with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>remains of extinct animals. On another occasion he
visited the cave together with Mr. Northmore and Dr.
Buckland. “Nothing remarkable was discovered that
day, excepting the tooth of a rhinoceros and a flint blade.
This was the first instance of the occurrence of British
relics being noticed in this or, I believe, any other cave.
Both these relics it was my good fortune to find.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He subsequently found many other flint implements,
but Dr. Buckland was not convinced that they occurred
in an undisturbed area. He believed that the ancient
Britons had scooped out ovens in the stalagmite, and
that through them the flint implements had reached their
position in the cave earth. In 1846 the Torquay Natural
History Society appointed a committee of investigation,
consisting of Pengelly and two others, who confirmed
MacEnery’s discovery of flint implements in conjunction
with extinct animals. Nevertheless, their evidence was
not accepted. In Pengelly’s words: “The scientific
world ... told us that our statements were impossible,
and we simply responded with the remark that we had
not said they were possible, only that they were true.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c018'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Lake Dwellings.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Before chronicling the final triumph of the cave
explorers in 1859, we may briefly note
another series of investigations which was
being carried on at the same time, and
which also shared in the work of throwing light on the
shadowy figure of prehistoric man. This was the excavation
of crannogs and lake dwellings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Irish Crannogs.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In 1839 Sir W. R. Wilde explored some of the Irish
crannogs, or semi-artificial islands,
usually made of layers of stone, logs,
sticks (the so-called fascine dwellings),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>resting on <i>cluans</i> or islets in the Irish lakes. The first
crannog explored was that at Lagore, famous in ancient
times as Loch Gobhair, near Dunshaughlin, co. Meath,
and mentioned in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> as
having been plundered in the ninth and tenth centuries.
It was originally discovered by accident. Some
labourers, when clearing out a stream in the neighbourhood,
came across very numerous bones, and also a
vast collection of objects of all descriptions, warlike and
domestic, made of stone, bone, wood, bronze, and iron,
and a few human remains.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next crannog to be disclosed was one in Roughan
Lake, near Dungannon; and thereafter more and more
came to light, until in 1857 forty-six had been recorded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The crannog finds, and the depth of the deposits,
indicated great age; and Sir William Wilde at once
recognised their significance in determining the history
of early human occupation in the island. This evidence
was strengthened by the discoveries shortly afterwards
made in Switzerland.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Swiss Pile-Dwellings.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>These were also partly the result of an accident. The
winter of 1853-4 happened to be particularly
cold and dry, and in consequence
tracts of the shores of the Swiss lakes,
which were normally covered by water, stood bare and
dry. The inhabitants of Ober Meilen, near Zürich,
took advantage of this to enclose part of the foreshore,
building walls, and filling the reclaimed space with
mud. During the necessary excavations various
remains came to light, stumps of piles, stone and horn
implements, etc. Dr. Ferdinand Keller, President of
the Antiquarian Society at Zürich, hearing of these
discoveries, hastened to explore the newly-revealed
area. Fishermen had long before reported on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>existence of a submerged forest, the stumps of which
caught their fishing nets and spoilt the fishing on the
sloping shores. In 1829, during excavations, some
piles were found, but, being attributed to the Romans,
no further notice was taken of them. Dr. Keller discovered
that the “submerged forest” was in reality of
human origin, formed of sharpened and pointed piles,
driven into the ground at regular intervals, and he
recognised here evidences of prehistoric human occupation,
corresponding with that recently proved for
Denmark. Pile dwellings were subsequently discovered
in the lakes of Biel, Sempach, Neufchatel, Geneva, and
Wallenstad, though investigations were only carried
out in Biel and Zürich. These yielded animal remains,
numerous stone implements, pottery, a skull, parts of
several skeletons, and one piece of bronze.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first the evidence was merely ignored, then it
was listened to, but discredited, or various ingenious
explanations were made to explain it away.</p>

<p class='c010'>But gradually the accumulated evidence became too
insistent to be ignored, and was supported by too great
names to be neglected. The caves of the Mendips,
explored by Williams and Beard, of North and South
Wales, explored by Stanley, of Yorkshire and of Devonshire,
the crannogs of Ireland and the pile dwellings of
Switzerland, all told the same tale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Brixham.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The turning point was reached in 1858. During that
year a new cave had been discovered
while excavating for building foundations
at Brixham, on the shores of Torbay,
Mr. Pengelly persuaded the owner to grant him a
refusal of the lease of the virgin site, and it was
submitted to a most careful examination. Thirty-six
rude flint implements were discovered in association
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>with the remains of hyænas, cave, brown and grizzly
bears, woolly rhinoceros and mammoth, in undisturbed
red loam beneath a layer of stalagmite.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was conclusive evidence. A paper read by
Mr. Pengelly at the meeting of the British Association
at Leeds, 1858, and supported by such authorities as
Charles Lyell, Ramsey, Prestwich,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c018'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Owen, and others,
clinched the argument, and the contemporary existence
of man with Pleistocene fauna was firmly established.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f93'>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Boucher de Perthes.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Boucher de Perthes, the son of a distinguished
botanist, was early attracted to the work
of cave-exploration, and in 1805 and
again in 1810 made discoveries of animal
bones and of flint implements which he recognised as
the work of man. Later on, when extensive excavations
for fortifications and railroads were being carried
on at Abbeville, he found the same type of implement
<i>in situ</i>, and in 1838 submitted some of his discoveries
and deductions to the Society of Emulation of Abbeville,
of which he was president. The next year he
brought the same evidence to Paris and showed his
flints to several members of the Institute. In 1847 he
published a description of his finds. In 1855 Rigollot,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c018'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
by his finds at Amiens, had confirmed the evidence produced
by Boucher de Perthes.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1858 Hugh Falconer, the palæontologist, visited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Abbeville to see the collection of implements made
by Boucher de Perthes, and “became satisfied that
there was a great deal of fair presumptive evidence
in favour of many of his speculations regarding the
remote antiquity of these industrial objects, and
their association with animals now extinct.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c018'><sup>[95]</sup></a> Acting
on Falconer’s suggestion, numerous geologists visited
Abbeville in the following year, including Sir Joseph
Prestwich, Sir John Evans, and Sir Charles Lyell;
and Arthur J. Evans, then a boy accompanying
his father, had the good fortune to find one of the
chipped flints <i>in situ</i>. This established the horizon of
the flints beyond question, though there were still some
who disputed the human workmanship. The English
archæologists and geologists however, had already
been convinced by the evidence of the Devonshire
caves, and the acceptance of “palæolithic man” on
the Continent dates from their visit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Subsequent Progress of Archæology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Thenceforward archæology made greater progress
abroad than in Great Britain, mainly,
perhaps, on account of the more numerous
materials for study.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>France.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>To indicate the share that France has had and
maintains in the elucidation of Prehistoric
Anthropology, we have only to mention
the work of É. Lartet with Mr. Henry
Christy on the French caves of Aurignac (1861) and
Périgord (1864); A. J. L. Bertrand and G. Bonstetten
on dolmens (1864, 1865, and 1879); É. Rivière on the
Mentone caves (1873); and the numerous works of E.
Chantre, especially with regard to the Rhone basin.
These and others prepared the way for the classic work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of G. de Mortillet (1883), whose masterly summary and
methodical treatment of the subject have been of great
service to all subsequent workers. While recognising
the labours of other investigators, special mention must
be made of Judge E. Piette (1827-1906), whose excavations
in the cave of Mas d’Azil constitute a landmark
in such studies. Professor E. Cartailhac, Dr. Capitan,
and l’Abbé H. Breuil have done further service in their
investigations in French caves; and the two latter, in
their beautiful memoir on the cave of Altamira in North
Spain, have further demonstrated the wonderful artistic
sense and technique of the cave-dwellers during the
later phases of Palæolithic times.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Britain we may note the names of J. Barnard
Davis, J. Thurnam, Rolleston, Sir Charles Lyell, Sir
John Evans, Canon Greenwell, and Professor Boyd
Dawkins, whose standard works have largely helped to
mould the course of archæology in our own country.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Germany, among the earlier writers may be mentioned
C. Fuhlrott, L. Lindenschmidt (1864-1881), J. A.
Ecker (1865-1870), A. Lissauer, and, above all, Rudolf
Virchow, the author of numerous and valuable contributions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsewhere, G. Nicolucci studied prehistoric man in
Italy, and during the last thirty years the investigations
of the illustrious Dr. Oskar Montelius, of Stockholm,
have been valued by all archæologists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Tertiary Man.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Boucher de Perthes was the vindicator of Quaternary
Man in France; l’Abbé Bourgeois stands
as the protagonist on behalf of Tertiary
Man.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first discovery of any traces of man’s existence
during Tertiary times was made in some sand and
gravel quarries at Saint Prest, near Chartres, by M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Desnoyers in 1863. He found various incised bones
bearing evidence of human workmanship, together
with remains of <i>Elephas meridionalis</i> and <i>Rhinoceros
leptorhinus</i>. But Sir Charles Lyell gave it as his
opinion, on examining the beds, that they were rather
late Quaternary than true Tertiary.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole question was hotly debated at the Second
Congress of Archæology and Prehistoric Anthropology
at Paris, in 1867, where l’Abbé Bourgeois (1819-1878),
Professor of Philosophy at Blois, exhibited his famous
flint implements from Miocene beds at Thenay, near
Tours, Loir-et-Cher. These were undoubtedly Miocene
beds, but it was open to doubt if the implements were
of human origin, and, if so, if they were found in
undisturbed positions. At the <i>Congrès International
d’Anthropologie</i> at Brussels in 1872 a committee of
fifteen was formed to discuss the problem, and opinions
were divided. Nine authorities recognised human
workmanship (one changed his opinion later); four
denied it; one was favourable, but with reserve; and
one was unable to decide at all. De Mortillet believed
that they had not been made by man himself, but by a
semi-human precursor of man, which he named <i>Homosimius
Bourgeoisii</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other finds of Tertiary man, those of the Upper
Miocene, by C. Ribeiro, at Otta, in the Tagus Valley,
1860; of Tardy in the same year, and of Rames in
1877, in beds of the same horizon at Puy-courny,
Auvergne; of Capellini, in Pliocene beds of Monte
Aperto, near Siena, and of Fritz Noetling in lower
Pliocene beds in Burma, 1894, have none of them been
received without question, and are still classed by
most authorities, as by Sir John Evans in 1870, and
again in 1897, as “Not proven.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Eoliths.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Closely connected with the question of Tertiary Man
is the “raging vortex of the eolith controversy,”
as Sollas describes it. Benjamin
Harrison, of Ightham, Kent, first
drew attention to these rude chipped flints, which
he found in the chalk plateau, and claimed to be of
pre-glacial age, and of human origin. Prestwich
accepted this view; Evans rejected it, and anthropologists
are still divided into opposite camps on the
question. Eoliths have since been discovered in various
parts of the world, and have merely served to confirm
the respective points of view of the partisans on either
side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sollas, after summing up all the evidence, says:
“When experts are thus at variance nothing remains
for the layman but to preserve an open mind.” These
discussions as to the existence of quaternary and
Tertiary man would have been settled once for all had
actual undoubted human bones been found in any of
the beds, but this was rarely the case, and disputants
had to rely almost entirely on questionable artifacts.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> history of that branch of Ethnology which is concerned
with the handicrafts of man is very brief.
Specimens of the arts and crafts of various races had
long been collected in museums, and till recent years
they were little more than curiosities or trophies; but,
owing to the inspiration of General Pitt-Rivers, they
are now proofs of stages in the evolution of human
thought or handicraft, or links in a chain of scientific
argument indicating the migrations or contacts of
peoples.</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Pitt-Rivers.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Augustus H. Lane-Fox (1827-1900) served with
distinction in the Crimea. In 1851 he
began to collect specimens to illustrate
his views. This, it will be remembered,
was eight years before the publication of the
<i>Origin of Species</i>. So Lane-Fox was to all intents
and purposes a pre-Darwinian evolutionist. Few
men have had the collecting instinct so strongly
developed, but there was invariably some principle or
theory that the objects he collected were designed to
illustrate. The spoils of over twenty years of intelligent
collecting were exhibited in 1874 in the Bethnal Green
Museum. The collection was a revelation to students,
and was the first application of the theory of evolution
to objects made by man. Colonel Lane-Fox succeeded
to vast estates in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire in 1880,
and assumed the name of Pitt-Rivers. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>year he commenced the series of excavations on his
estate which are models of scientific “digging.” The
Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford, and that at Farnham
in Dorsetshire, are fitting monuments of his genius.
The curator of the former museum, Mr. H. Balfour,
is ably carrying on the methods of Pitt-Rivers, and has
made valuable investigations on the evolution of musical
and other implements.</p>

<p class='c010'>Otis T. Mason (1838-1908), of the United States
National Museum, paid particular attention to the implements
and processes of the technology of backward
peoples, more especially of the aborigines of North
America; and he was also interested in the wider
aspects of human industrial development.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pitt-Rivers was certainly one of the first to demonstrate
that patterns and designs may be studied from
the point of view of evolution; but he did not make
any detailed studies in this direction. The first systematic
treatise in this fascinating field of investigation
was by Dr. H. Colley March, who, in <i>The Meaning of
Ornament</i> (1889),<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c018'><sup>[96]</sup></a> utilised certain views put forward by
Gottfried Semper in his valuable book <i>Der Stil</i> (1860-1863);
but for over a decade the distinguished Swedish
archæologist and ethnologist, Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe
(1841-1905), had been amassing data to illustrate the
evolution and distribution of ornamentation, and he published
a memoir on Polynesian art in 1890, which was
followed by one on American art in 1896. Dr. C. H.
Read,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c018'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Mr. H. Balfour (1893),<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c018'><sup>[98]</sup></a> and others, worked on

has also been accomplished by American and
German ethnologists.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Those</span> branches of cultural anthropology which deal
with comparative sociology and magico-religious data
are sometimes designated as “ethnology.” It frequently
happens that students who have written upon these and
closely allied subjects have in the same book treated
the archæological, technical, and linguistic aspects of
cultural anthropology or ethnology in the larger sense.
It is therefore impossible to keep to a precise classification
of the subject when dealing with it historically.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Comparative Ethnology.</b></div>
<p class='c010'>The main stumbling-block in the way of comparative
ethnology was the difficulty of establishing
the study on a firm scientific basis.
“Man cannot be secluded from disturbing

<p class='c022'>To remove this reproach was the work of Professor
Tylor.</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Edward Burnett Tylor.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>It is difficult to express in adequate terms what
Professor E. B. Tylor has done for
ethnology. He is the founder of the
science of comparative ethnology; and
his two great works, <i>Early History of
Mankind</i> (1865) and <i>Primitive Culture</i> (1871), while
replete with vast erudition, are so suggestive and
graced by such a charming literary style and quiet
humour that they have become “classics,” and have
profoundly influenced modern thought. From their
first appearance it was recognised that a master-mind
was guiding the destinies of the nascent science. Some
idea of the magnitude and diversity of his work may be
gathered from the bibliography of 262 items, published
between 1861 and 1907, collected by Miss Freire-Marreco,
<i>Anthropological Essays Presented to Edward
Burnett Tylor in Honour of his Seventy-first Birthday,
Oct. 2, 1907</i>. An appreciation of the labours of Professor
Tylor is given by Andrew Lang in this volume.
The true significance of the aims of “Mr. Tylor’s
Science,” as Max Müller called it, may be best
gathered from Professor Tylor’s own words:—</p>

<p class='c021'>For years past it has become evident that the great
need of anthropology is that its methods should be
strengthened and systematised. The world has not been
unjust to the growing science, far from it. Wherever
anthropologists have been able to show definite evidence
and inference, for instance, in the development series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>arts in the Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford, not only
specialists, but the educated world generally, are ready
to receive the results and assimilate them into public
opinion. Strict method has, however, as yet, only been
introduced over part of the anthropological field. There
has yet to be overcome a certain not unkindly hesitancy
on the part of men engaged in the precise operations of
mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, to admit that
the problems of anthropology are amenable to scientific
treatment. It is my aim to show that the development
of institutions may be investigated on a basis of tabulation
and classification.</p>

<p class='c022'>This is the opening of a masterly paper “On a
Method of Investigating the Development of Institutions;
applied to Laws of Marriage and Descent.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c018'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The tabular method is not applicable to much of the
vast mass of material with which Tylor dealt; but the
accuracy and systematising of method are found throughout,
and were of invaluable service to a science peculiarly
attractive to the vague speculator and enthusiastic
<i>dilettante</i>.</p>
<p class='c010'>Tylor (1871) insisted on the necessity of sifting and
testing all the evidence, relying to a great extent on
“the test of recurrence,” or of undesigned coincidence
in testimony; he says: “the more odd the statement,
the less likely that several people in several
places should have made it wrongly. This being so,
it seems reasonable to judge that the statements are in
the main truly given, and that their close and regular
coincidence is due to the cropping-up of similar facts in
various districts of culture. Now the most important
facts of ethnography are vouched for in this way”
(2nd ed., 1873, p. 10).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Avebury.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>A further stimulus to the study of comparative ethnology
in this country was given by the
publication of Sir John Lubbock’s (Lord
Avebury’s) <i>Origin of Civilisation</i> (1870),
and opened the eyes of a large public to the interest
of ethnology and its value in throwing light upon the
earlier stages of culture of civilised peoples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Sociology.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The question as to the influence of environment on
the development of social organisation is
as old as the world’s oldest thinkers, and
finds expression in Aristotle and in Plato,
though Sociology, as a science, is a product of the
last century. The word “Sociology” was first used
by Auguste Comte (1798-1857), who showed its aim
to be to discover the nature, the natural causes, and
the natural laws of society. With the development
of natural science came the insistence on a naturalistic
interpretation of social differences, demonstrated by
Guyot (1807-1884) and Draper (1811-1882), and over-emphasised
by Buckle (1821-1862).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Comte Buckle.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Comte’s method was that of deductive construction
and prescription. Buckle’s plan was to
evolve a social science inductively through
a study of history, with the help of
economics and statistics. His <i>History of Civilisation</i>
answers the great question which he sets himself:
“Are the actions of men, and therefore of societies,
governed by fixed laws, or are they the result either of
chance or of supernatural interference?” He attempted
to show how “Climate, Food, Soil, and the General
Aspect of Nature” were the dominant influences in
early societies, determining the food supply, the degree
of population, and the economic condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unfortunately, in pursuit of this idea Buckle was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>apt to overlook the influences of culture-contact, and of
economic factors; thus deserving, to some extent, the
censure of Jevons: “Buckle referred the character of a
nation to the climate and the soil of its abode.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c018'><sup>[101]</sup></a> At
the same time Buckle must be regarded as the first
historical sociologist of the modern scientific movement.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Herbert Spencer.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The evolutionist explanation of the natural world as
applied to sociology found its fullest
exponent in Herbert Spencer (1820-1903),
who studied the anatomy of the social
frame. He derived the principles of sociology from
the principles of psychology and of biology, and regarded
social development as a super-organic evolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>But all these earlier attempts to discover a social
science were speculative rather than practical. The
solid foundations of inductive sociology were laid by
Bachofen, Morgan, J. F. McLennan, and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Bachofen, Morgan, McLennan, and others.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Bachofen (1861) was the first to study the system of
filiation through the mother, or mother-right,
which was widely distributed
among ancient peoples, and still occurs
in many regions in a more or less
developed condition. McLennan frankly
states that “the honour of that discovery, the importance
of which, as affording a new starting-point for all
history, cannot be over-estimated, must, without stint
or qualification, be assigned to him” (1876, p. 421).
Independently, however, J. F. McLennan (1827-1881),
in his <i>Primitive Marriage</i> (1865), arrived at the
conclusion “that the most ancient system in which the
idea of blood-relationship was embodied was a system
of kinship through females only.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c018'><sup>[102]</sup></a> He points out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>more than once that “Mr. Maine seems not to have
been able to conceive of any social order more primitive
than the patriarchal.”<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c018'><sup>[103]</sup></a> This book was reprinted with
additions in 1876, and his two other books were published
posthumously (1885, 1896). In these and more
fugitive writings McLennan was a keen controversialist,
and with unnecessary vigour and animus
attacked Morgan, Sir Henry Maine, and Dr. Howitt.
McLennan’s attitude may be partly explained by the
fact that he was a lawyer and a theorist, but he
possessed great enthusiasm, with which he infused
those who came into contact with him, and his labours
served to advance the study of sociology.</p>

points out that “In recent years the scheme has encountered
much opposition.... The opponents of Morgan
have made no attempt to distinguish between different
parts of his scheme, but, having shown that certain
of its features are unsatisfactory, they have condemned
the whole.” The greater part of Morgan’s work is,
however, of lasting value. Morgan based his conclusions
on an enormous number of kinship terms collected
by himself and others from every available source.
Dr. Rivers has introduced<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c018'><sup>[107]</sup></a> a new method of collecting
similar data by means of recording exhaustive
genealogies from a limited area. In this way not only
can kinship terms be collected with accuracy, but a large
number of other sociological data are obtained with a
readiness and precision not hitherto possible. Indeed,
it is no exaggeration to say that this method is producing
a revolution in the method of sociological field
work.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a later book (1878) Morgan summarised his earlier
conclusions and proposed a classification of culture
consisting of a lower, middle, and an upper Status of
Savagery, a lower, middle, and an upper Status of
Barbarism, and the Status of Civilisation based upon
certain inventions and industries.</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time various students wrote on marriage
and the family, of whom the foremost were Giraud
Teulon (1867, 1874, 1884), H. Post (1875), Letourneau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>(1888), Von Hellwald (1889), and others, the conclusions
of the earlier writers being summed up by Professor
E. Westermarck in his masterly <i>History of
Human Marriage</i> (1891); but much has been written
since that date on this subject of perennial interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Professor F. H. Giddings, in his <i>Principles of
Sociology</i>, sums up in the following words the trend
of modern writers on ethnological sociology:—</p>

<p class='c021'>Professor Ludwig Gumplowicz [1883] has tried to
demonstrate that the true elementary social phenomena
are the conflicts, amalgamations, and assimilations of
heterogeneous ethnical groups. M. Novicow [1893],
generalising further, argues that social evolution is
essentially a progressive modification of conflict by
alliance, in the course of which conflict itself is transformed
from a physical into an intellectual struggle.
Professor De Greef [1886], looking at the question in a
very different way, finds the distinctive social fact in
contract, and measures social progress according to the
displacement of coercive authority by conscious argument.
Mr. Gabriel Tarde [1890], in an original and
fascinating study, which has made an enduring impress
on both psychological and sociological thought, argues
that the primordial social fact is imitation, a phenomenon
antecedent to all mutual aid, division of labour, and
contract. Professor Émile Durkheim [1895], dissenting
from the conclusions of M. Tarde, undertakes to prove
that the characteristically social process, and therefore
the ultimate social phenomenon, is a coercion of every
individual mind by modes of action, thought, and feeling
that are external to itself (p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>).</p>
<p class='c022'>According to Giddings, the original and elementary
subjective fact in society is “the consciousness of kind.”</p>
<p class='c010'>Social psychology offers a vast and fertile field which
has been but little worked, and there was needed an
introduction to the subject which should afford that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>general point of view which is the starting-point of
further studies. This Dr. W. McDougall has attempted
in a recently published little book.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c018'><sup>[108]</sup></a> His general conclusion
is that the life of societies is not merely the
sum of the activities of individuals moved by enlightened
self-interest, or by intelligent desire for pleasure and
aversion from pain; but that the springs of all the
complex activities that make up the life of societies
must be sought in the instincts and in the other
primary tendencies that are common to all men and are
deeply rooted in the remote ancestry of the race.
Professor E. A. Ross, of Wisconsin, simultaneously
attacked the same subject, on the problems of which
he had previously written.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c018'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Magic and Religion.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Magic and religion are very generally held to be
not only distinct from one another, but
antithetical. There is, however, a tendency
among certain living students to
regard them as analogous phenomena, both being
expressions of a belief in a power or energy which may
be designated by the Melanesian term “mana,” or the
American “orenda.” It has more than once been
pointed out that it is in some cases very hard—perhaps
impossible—to determine whether certain
actions can be classed as either magical or religious,
as they appear to belong to both categories. As in
the case of religion from the ethnological standpoint,
magic has been investigated in the field, and immediate
references to it are to be found in ethnological literature—the
comparative study of magic has to some extent
been undertaken by Frazer, Jevons, and others; but one
of the most important contributions to the subject is by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Hubert and Mauss,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c018'><sup>[110]</sup></a> who treat it from a sociological

religion; and not only the Christian
religion, but the Protestant religion; and
not only the Protestant religion, but the
Church of England.” Anthropology, by
a reverse process, passes “in larger sympathy from
specific creeds to partake of the universal spirit which
every creed tries to embody.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c018'><sup>[111]</sup></a> The interest of Anthropology

has nothing to do with the truth or falsehood
of religion—it holds itself absolutely and entirely aloof
from such questions—but the natural history of religion,
and the origin and growth of the religions entertained
by the different tribes of the human race, are within its
proper and legitimate province.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This is not the place to attempt a definition of
religion—a task which has led to so many failures. We
must be content with the statement that it most
frequently presents itself under the aspects of ritual,
myth, and belief. Anthropology has hitherto practically
confined its attention to ritual and myth, and but too
frequently exclusively to the last.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Andrew Lang (1887)<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c018'><sup>[113]</sup></a> points out, in the sixth
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Xenophanes complained that the gods
were credited with the worst crimes, and other classical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>writers were shocked at the contradictions between the
conception and ritual worship of the same god. In
ancient Egypt the priests strove to shift the burden of
absurdity and sacrilege from their own deities. It
taxed the ingenuity of pious Brahmans to explain the
myths which made Indra the slayer of a Brahman.
Euhemerus (316 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), in his philosophical romance,
<i>Sacra Historica</i>, in rationalising the fables about the
gods was regarded as an atheist. Certain writers like
Plutarch (60 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) and Porphyry (270 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) made the
ancient deities types of their own favourite doctrines,
whatever these might happen to be. The early
Christians had a good case against the heathen.
Eusebius, in the <i>Præparatio Evangelica</i>, anticipating
Andrew Lang himself, “ridiculed, with a good deal of
humour, the old theories which resolved so many
mythical heroes into the sun” (p. 20). “The physical
interpreters,” said Eusebius, “do not even agree in
their physical interpretations.” The light of the anthropological
method had dawned on Eusebius. Many
centuries later Spencer, Master of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge (1630-93), had no other scheme in
his mind in his erudite work on Hebrew ritual,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c018'><sup>[114]</sup></a> which
he considered was but an expurgated adaptation of
heathen customs. Fontenelle<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c018'><sup>[115]</sup></a> explained the irrational
element in myth as inherited from savagery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The revival of learning made scholars acquainted
with the religions not only of Greece and Rome, but of
the nations with whom the Greeks and Romans had
come in contact—Egyptians, Semites, Persians, and
Indians. Travellers gave accounts of the religions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>they found in remote parts of the world, and missionaries
reported on beliefs and customs of many
nations. These were the sources from which were
compiled the comprehensive works on religion, from
Alexander Ross, <i>View of All the Religions in the World</i>,
etc., 1652, to Dupuis, <i>Origine de tous les cultes ou Religion
Universelle</i>, 1794. All heathen religions were believed
to be based on sun and star worship.</p>

<p class='c010'>New vistas were opened up by the writings of De
Brosses (1760), who investigated the beliefs of savage
races and based all religion on “Fetishism.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To quote once more from Lang: “In the beginning
of the [nineteenth] century Germany turned her attention
to mythology. In a pious kind of spirit, Friedrich
Creuzer [1771-1858] sought to find symbols of some
pure, early, and Oriental theosophy in the myths and
mysteries of Greece. The great Lobeck, in his <i>Aglaophamus</i>
(1829), brought back common-sense, and made
it the guide of his vast, his unequalled learning. In a
gentler and more genial spirit, C. Ottfried Müller [1797-1840]
laid the foundation of a truly scientific and historical
mythology. Neither of these writers had, like
Alfred Maury [1857], much knowledge of the myths and
faiths of the lower races, but they often seem on the
point of anticipating the ethnological method.” (<i>L.c.</i>,
p. 23.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Folklore.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The mythological aspect of the subject was illuminated
by the researches of the brothers
Grimm (J. L. K., 1785-1863; W. K.,
1786-1859), whose collections of Märchen
(1812-5) were found to contain Teutonic myths, and
by their resemblance to Norse, Greek, and Vedic
mythology suggested that in German folklore were
remains of a common Indo-Germanic tradition. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>was the beginning of the intelligent study of Folklore.
Mannhardt (1865) and others investigated popular, and
especially peasant, customs and beliefs connected with
agriculture and vegetation; and showed that here, in
what Christianity had reduced to superstition, were to
be found survivals of the religions that Christianity had
supplanted. Thenceforward the study of Folklore, and
of the “lower mythology” of beliefs, customs, and
superstitions, gradually developed into a science, which
is now recognised as the valuable ally of Anthropology.
Meanwhile the anthropological signification of religion
was emerging from the mass of materials collected
from all over the globe. Anthropology established its
universality, and made many attempts to find a common
factor, first in astral worship, then in Euhemerism
(Banier, 1738), Fetishism (De Brosses, 1709-1777),
Nature-worship (Max Müller, etc.), Ancestor-worship
(Herbert Spencer, Lippert [1866], etc.), and later in
Totemism. These hypotheses were based on the erroneous
assumption that savage religion represented the
primitive mode of thought, out of which civilised
religions had evolved. Later it was realised that
“The Australian black or the Andaman Islander is
separated by as many generations from the beginning
of religion as his most advanced contemporaries; and
in these tens or hundreds of thousands of years there
has been constant change, growth, and decay—and
decay is not a simple return to the primal state. We
can learn a great deal from the lowest existing religions,
but they cannot tell us what the beginning of religion
was, any more than the history of language can tell us
what was the first human speech.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c018'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Comparative Religion.</b></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The study of comparative religion, though not originated
by Max Müller (1823-1900), owed
much to his energy. His lectures on
Comparative Mythology (1856) were
followed by lectures on the Science of Religion (1870),
and on the religions of the world (1873). He inaugurated
the annual series of the Hibbert Lectures with a study
of the origin and growth of Religion, as illustrated by
the religions of India; and as Gifford lecturer at
Glasgow (1888-1892), discussed Natural Religion,
Physical Religion, Anthropological Religion, and Theosophy
or Psychological Religion. His <i>Contributions to
the Science of Mythology</i> appeared in 1897. His method
of investigation was almost entirely linguistic, based on
phonetic laws which later research has discredited; and
his theory of “mythology as the disease of language”
is no longer tenable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The charm of the writings of Max Müller, and the
interest which they awakened in Vedic studies, gave a
new impulse to the study of the history of religions. The
hymns of the Rig-Veda are by no means the product of
a simple society, as he supposed; in his view hymns and
myths were dissociated from ritual religion, and gods
were identified with natural objects. The death-blow to
this method of studying religion in our country was
given by the keen criticism of Andrew Lang (1884,
1887). The too-narrow basis of Max Müller’s theories
was overthrown by arguments derived from comparative
ethnology; “the silly, senseless, and savage element”
(as he termed it) in classical mythology proved to be the
stumbling-block over which he fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>A firmer foundation for the study was laid by Tylor
and Lubbock. Though Max Müller originated the
name Science of Religion, it was Tylor who first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>introduced into it a scientific method, and so laid the
foundations for future investigation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Later workers in the field fall naturally into two
groups. Some make intensive studies of particular
forms of religion, either historical, such as Robertson
Smith (1846-1894), or living, such as Codrington in
Melanesia, J. O. Dorsey<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c018'><sup>[117]</sup></a> in America, Spencer and
Gillen in Australia, and many others.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Other workers attempt, by correlating the mass of
material, to discover the fundamental religious conceptions
of man, and to trace their subsequent development.
Among these may be noted Grant Allen,
Crawley, Frazer, Hartland, Jevons, Andrew Lang,
Marett, and many others.</p>

<p class='c010'>To those who are acquainted with the modern study
of comparative religion in this country it is unnecessary
to point out the influence of such workers as Mannhardt,
Tylor, and Robertson Smith on subsequent
writers; nor is it needful to draw attention to the vast
erudition and eloquent writing of Professor J. G.
Frazer, whose monumental work on <i>The Golden Bough</i>
has become a classic, or to the memorable <i>Legend of
Perseus</i> by E. S. Hartland.</p>

<p class='c010'>The study of the myths of various peoples is receiving
the attention of numerous students, and in Germany
certain ethnologists, such as Ehrenreich, Foy,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c018'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and
Frobenius,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c018'><sup>[119]</sup></a> find sun and moon gods in the most unlikely
places. There is, however, considerable danger
that this nature-mythology is being carried too far.</p>

    <div>LINGUISTICS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Linguistics</span> as a department of Anthropology may be
regarded from many points of view. To the evolutionist
language forms one of the tests dividing the
Hominidæ from the other anthropoids; the somatologist
is interested in correlating the phonetic system with the
structure of the organs connected with the mechanism
of speech; and the ethnologist studies language for
the evidence it affords of ethnic affinity or social contact,
or as a means of determining the grade of culture
to which a particular people has attained, or, again, as
a reflection of their character or psychology. The
linguistic classifications of Gallatin, Humboldt, and
Müller are referred to later.</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>The Aryan Controversy.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The connection between linguistics and anthropology
assumed its greatest importance in the
middle of the nineteenth century, when
the discoveries and theories of philologists
were adopted wholesale to explain the problems of
European ethnology, and the Aryan controversy became
the <i>locus</i> of disturbance throughout the Continent.
“No other scientific question, with the exception,
perhaps, of the doctrine of evolution, was ever so
bitterly discussed or so infernally confounded at the
hands of Chauvinistic or otherwise biassed writers.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c018'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In 1786 Sir William Jones had pointed out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>relationship between Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German,
and Celtic, and suggested a common parentage, which
was confirmed by Bopp in 1835. Unfortunately, a
primitive unity of speech was held to imply a primitive
unity of race.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the ethnological papers read at the meeting
of the British Association in 1847 was one “On the
Results of the recent Egyptian Researches in reference
to Asiatic and African Ethnology, and the Classification
of Languages,” in which Baron Bunsen sought to show
that the whole of mankind could be classified according
to language. In fact, it was taken for granted in 1847
that the study of comparative philology would be in
future the only safe foundation for the study of anthropology.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c018'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
The spread of this fallacy is usually attributed
to Max Müller, whose charm of style and high reputation
as a Sanskrit scholar did much to popularise the
new science of philology. He invented the term
“Aryan,” which in itself contains two erroneous
assumptions—one linguistic, that the Indo-Iranian
group of languages is older than its relatives; and the
other geographical, that its “cradle” was in ancient
Ariana, in Central Asia. Moreover, in his lectures he
not only spoke of an Aryan language, but of an “Aryan
race.” He is credited with having made “heroic
reparation” for these errors when he wrote later: “To
me an ethnologist who speaks of an Aryan race, Aryan
blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a
linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or
a brachycephalic grammar. It is worse than a Babylonian
confusion of tongues—it is downright theft.”
But, as he pointed out,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c018'><sup>[123]</sup></a> he himself never shared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>misconception that he was accused of launching on the
world. He admits that he was not entirely without
blame, as he allowed himself occasionally the freedom
to speak of the Aryan or the Semitic race, meaning the
people who spoke Aryan or Semitic languages; but as
early as 1853 he had protested against the intrusion of
linguistics into ethnology, and</p>

<p class='c021'>called, if not for a complete divorce, at least for a judicial
separation between the study of Philology and the study
of Ethnology.... The phonologist should collect his
evidence, arrange his classes, divide and combine as if
no Blumenbach had ever looked at skulls, as if no Camper
had ever measured facial angles, as if no Owen had ever
examined the base of a cranium. His evidence is the
evidence of language, and nothing else; this he must
follow, even though in the teeth of history, physical or
political.... There ought to be no compromise between
ethnological and phonological science. It is only by
stating the glaring contradictions between the two that
truth can be elicited.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c018'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The protest was in vain. The belief in an “Aryan race”
became an accepted fact both in linguistics and in
ethnology, and its influence vitiates the work of many
anthropologists even at the present day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Naturally the question of the identity of the Aryan
race was soon a subject of keen debate. The French
and German schools at once assumed opposite sides,
the Germans claiming that the Aryans were tall, fair,
and long-headed, the ancestors of the modern Teutons;
and the French, mainly on cultural evidence, claiming
that the language, together with civilisation, came into
Europe with the Alpine race, which forms such a large
element in the modern French population.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>There are two ways in which linguistics may be
studied as an aid to Anthropology—first, with regard to
structural analysis, by which linguistic affinities may be
proved; secondly, by what has been called “linguistic
palæontology,” or the study of root words, by means
of which the original culture of a people may be ascertained.
Philology pushed both these methods too far.
It claimed the right, by proof of structural analysis, to
link up the racial relationships of the European and
Asiatic peoples, and, by linguistic palæontology, to
determine the culture of the original “Aryans,” and to
identify their original home. It was over the question
of the “Aryan cradle” that they were forced to relinquish
their too ambitious claims.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the beginning of the nineteenth century it was
generally believed that our first ancestors were created
in 4004 B.C. and spoke Hebrew, and that the origin of
the European languages dated from the migration of
Japhet from the plains of Shinar, <i>cir.</i> 2247. The Asiatic
origin of race and language was for long unchallenged.
But in 1839 Omalius d’Halloy, followed by Latham in
1851, began to cast doubts on the Asiatic “cradle,”
noting that the Asiatic languages had no real claim to
be considered older than those of Europe, and that in
many ways the Lithuanian and Armenian were the most
archaic in the family. More important still was the
work of Benfey,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c018'><sup>[125]</sup></a> who may be regarded as the originator
of linguistic palæontology, and who used its evidence
to shift the original dispersal from Asia to Europe.
Various philologists followed, employing different
methods to prove different theories; and the Aryan
cradle was located in many parts of Europe and Asia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>ranging from the Pamir plateau to the Baltic plains.
Max Müller confessed in 1888 that “the evidence is so
pliant that it is possible to make out a more or less
plausible case” for almost any part of the world.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Language and Race.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>From claiming too much the swing of the pendulum
brought linguistics into disrepute with
ethnologists, and for a time the evidence
of language was looked upon with suspicion.
Even philologists were accused of going too
far in this direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Professor Sayce<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c018'><sup>[126]</sup></a> says: “Identity or relationship of
language can prove nothing more than social contact....
Language is an aid to the historian, not to the
ethnologist.” But, as Professor Keane points out,
there are many cases in which language infallibly proves
the existence of ethnic elements which would otherwise
have been unsuspected—as, for example, in the case of
the Basques of Europe. “Language used with judgment
is thus seen to be a great aid to the ethnologist
in determining racial affinities, and in solving many
anthropological difficulties” (1896, p. 205).</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Max Müller wrote nearly twenty years
ago, “I believe the time will come when no anthropologist
will venture to write on anything concerning
the inner life of man without having himself acquired
a knowledge of the language in which that inner life
finds its truest expression,” we are obliged still to echo
his lament: “How few of the books in which we trust
with regard to the characteristics or peculiarities of
savage races have been written by men ... who have
learnt their languages until they could speak them as
well as the natives themselves!”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c018'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

    <div>CULTURAL CLASSIFICATION AND THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>We</span> have seen that in its beginning the science of man
was little more than a branch of zoology, and that his
structural characters were the first to attract attention
and to form the material of study; hence all the earlier
classifications were based on physical features. Gallatin
was one of the first to classify mankind rather by what
they <i>do</i> than by what they <i>are</i>.</p>
<div class='sidenote'><b>Gallatin.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) was born at Geneva,
emigrated to America before he was
twenty, and rose rapidly to the position
of one of the foremost of American statesmen,
becoming United States Minister to France, and
later to England. He noted the unsatisfactoriness of
groupings by colour, stature, head-form, etc., in the
case of the races of America, and made a preliminary
classification of the native tribes on the basis of language.
Major J. W. Powell (1834-1902) and Dr. Brinton
(1837-1899) elaborated the linguistic classification of the
American Indians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Wilhelm von Humboldt.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Classification by language had already been utilised
by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835)
in the introduction to his great work on
the Kawi language of Java, entitled
<i>Ueber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues
und ihren Einfluss auf die geistige Entwickelung des
Menschengeschlechts</i>, which was published posthumously,
1836-40. The rise of the new science of philology gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>a fresh impetus to this method of classification, which
was adopted by F. Müller (1834-1898), and utilised
recently by Deniker and various other writers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other classifications, by means of cultural distinctions,
have been attempted. Among these may be
noted that based on mythology and religion of Max
Müller, on institutions and social organisation of
Morgan and Ratzel, or on musical systems of Fétis.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Hippocrates.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Hippocrates (<i>c.</i> 460-377), in his work, <i>About Air,
Water, and Places</i>, first discusses the influence
of environment on man, physical,
moral, and pathological. He divided mankind
into groups, impressed with homogeneous characters
by homogeneous surroundings, demonstrating that
mountains, plains, damp, aridity, and so on, produced
definite and varying types.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Bodin.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Bodin, writing in 1577 <i>Of the Lawes and Customes of
a Common Wealth</i> (English edition, 1605),
contains, as Professor J. L. Myres has
pointed out,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c018'><sup>[128]</sup></a> “the whole pith and kernel
of modern anthropo-geography.... His climatic contrasts
are based on the Ptolemaic geography ... and he
argues as if the world broke off short at Sahara.... On
his classification of environments from arctic North to
tropic South” he superposes “a cross-division by grades
of culture from civil East to barbaric West.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Buffon.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Buffon followed Hippocrates. Man, said Buffon,
consists of a single species. Individual
variations are due to three causes—climate,
food, and habits. These influences,
acting over large areas on large groups of
people, produce general and constant varieties. To these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>varieties he gave the name of <i>race</i>.  This doctrine was
the main support of the monogenists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Alexander von Humboldt, Ritter, and Waitz.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>The year 1859 marks a crisis in this field of research,
as in so many others. Alexander von
Humboldt (1769-1859), the Prussian
naturalist and traveller, spent the later
part of his life in writing his classic
<i>Kosmos</i>, a summary and exposition of
the laws and conditions of the physical
universe. Karl Ritter (1779-1859), Professor of Geography
at the University of Berlin, published, between
1822 and his death, the ten volumes of <i>Die Erdkunde im
Verhältniss zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen</i>.
These works formed the basis from which was developed
the German view of geography as a science of the
co-relation of distribution. In 1859 Waitz, in his
<i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i>, insisted on the inter-relation
between the physical organisation and the
psychic life of mankind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Buckle.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>Between 1857 and 1861 appeared Buckle’s <i>History of
Civilisation</i>, in which the influence of
environment on mankind is strongly
emphasised. “To one of these four
classes (Climate, Food, Soil, and the General Aspect of
Nature) may be referred all the external phenomena by
which Man has been permanently affected.”<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c018'><sup>[129]</sup></a> The
recognition of the environmental influence has long
been a characteristic of the French school. Ripley
(1900, p. 4) points out that, wherever the choice lies
between heredity and environment, the French almost
always prefer the latter as the explanation of the phenomenon.
This is seen from the time of Bodin (1530-1596)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and Montesquieu (1689-1755), with their objective
explanations of philosophy, and Cuvier, who
traced the close relationship between philosophy and
geological formation, to Turquan (1896), who mapped
out the awards made by the Paris Salon, showing the
coincidence of the birth-place of the artists with the
fertile river basins.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Ratzel. Reclus.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>In Germany the exponents of these theories were
Cotta and Kohl, and later Peschel, Kirchhoff, Bastian,
and Gerland; but the greatest name of
all is that of Friedrich Ratzel (1844-1904),
who has written the standard work on
<i>Anthropo-Geographie</i> (1882-91). Another monumental
work is that by Élisée Reclus (1820-1905),
<i>Nouvelle Géographie Universelle</i> (1879-1894).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><b>Le Play.</b></div>

<p class='c010'>A great stimulus to the development of ethnological
sociology was given by the school of Le
Play in France, the concrete application
of whose theories was worked out by
Demolins and others, and published in <i>La
Science Sociale</i> and separate works. It is the essential
procedure of the followers of this school, in their studies
in descriptive sociology, to begin with the environment,
and to trace its effects upon the occupation of the people,
their sociology, and so forth. The method is an extremely
suggestive one, and has led to many brilliant generalisations.
The danger consists in theorising from imperfect
data, and there is a tendency to attribute certain
social conditions directly to the influences of environment
and occupation, where a wider knowledge of ethnology
would show that these or analogous social conditions
obtained in other places where they were not produced
by the causes suggested.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>RETROSPECT</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>On</span> taking a brief final survey of the history of anthropology,
one is struck by the fact that, owing to the
tendency of students to limit their attention to one of
the varied subjects which are grouped under the term
Anthropology, the progress of the science has been
very irregular.</p>
<p class='c010'>Physical anthropology has had very numerous
devotees, who have approached the subject mainly from
the point of view of small anatomical variations; but
even at the present day the significance of many of the
details is not understood, and very little advance has
been made concerning the criteria of racial anatomy.
We have yet to discover how adequately to describe
or gauge the essential anatomical distinctions between
races and peoples. This problem is complicated by our
ignorance of the stability of physical characters, and of
how far or how speedily they are affected by change of
environment. At the present time the effects of miscegenation
and of environment afford fruitful fields for
research. The imperfection of the geological record is
answerable for the relatively slow progress that has been
made in tracing the evolution of man as an animal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whereas the structural characters of man have been
studied by trained scientific men, the history of man
from a cultural point of view has mainly been investigated
by literary men, who have approached the subject
from various sides, and, from lack of experience in the
field or by virtue of their natural reliance upon documentary
evidence, have often not been sufficiently
critical regarding their authorities. The comparative
method has yielded most valuable results, but it is
liable to lead the unwary into mistakes. To employ
biological terms, analogy is apt to be mistaken for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>homology, since customs or beliefs (which, it must be
remembered, are in the vast majority of cases extremely
imperfectly recorded) may have a superficial resemblance.
If all the facts were known, they might be found
to have had a very different origin or significance. Comparisons
made within a given area or among cognate
peoples have a greater value than those drawn from
various parts of the world. What is most needed at
the present day is intensive study of limited areas;
the studies already so made have proved most fruitful.
Although we know a good deal about many forms of
social organisation, we find that in very few cases is
the knowledge sufficiently precise to explain them,
owing to the fact that the data were not collected by
adequately trained observers. In other words, cultural
anthropology has been too much at the mercy of students
who have not received a sufficiently rigorous training.</p>

<p class='c010'>The objects made by man have only recently been
subjected to critical study. In this the archæologists
have been in advance of the ethnologists. The distribution
of objects and its significance have been studied
more in Germany than elsewhere, and already afford
promising results.</p>

<p class='c010'>Anthropology is slowly becoming a coherent and
organised science. The chief danger to which it is
liable is that its fascination and popularity, touching as
it does every department of human thought and activity,
tend to premature generalisations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The history of Anthropology, like that of most other
sciences, is full of examples of opposition from the prejudice
and bigotry of those who place more reliance on
tradition than on the results of investigations and the
logical deductions therefrom; but the reactionaries have
always had to give way in the end.</p>
